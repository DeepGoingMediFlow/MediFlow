Our findings highlight key differences in how ED clinicians perceive the influence of various work system elements on their performance of the disposition decision-making process in that only 19 out of the 33 elements (58%) were given similar ratings under low and high demand. Variations in ratings between low and high demand represent meaningful differences in the ED work system structure that ultimately change how the disposition decision-making process is performed. Understanding how the influence of ED work system elements varies across the demand continuum can motivate the design of interventions and system structures that are responsive to the dynamic demands of the ED. Our study also introduced a novel application and approach to creating configural diagrams. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to use configuration to assess \n","126  differences in the same work system and the same process at under different conditions (i.e., under different demands).   7.4.1 Work system configuration under low and high demand Previous studies have highlighted the role nearly every work system component has in influencing the ED disposition decision-making process (Rutkowski, Scheer, et al., In progress). However, no one study has comprehensively characterized all components of the work system and the influence those elements have on process performance. Using a modified Delphi approach, the present study explored the influence that previously identified elements have on the ED disposition decision-making process under conditions of low and high demand. Our configural diagramming approach provides the subsequent layer of analysis needed to translate descriptive findings into perspective insights that can inform future research or system design by highlighting the elements that most strongly influence the ED disposition decision-making process under both low and high demand (Holden et al., 2013).  We found that ED clinicians perceived most elements (58%) to have the same influence on ED disposition decision-making, regardless of demand. This could indicate that the influence level of these elements may be immune to the dynamic, broader work system context. As such, intervening on elements perceived as consistently, highly influential on the ED disposition decision-making process has the potential to have a meaningful and sustained effect on process performance under varied conditions. There were two elements rated as highly influential under conditions of low and high demand: patient preference and psychosocial factors. This suggests that these elements may represent areas in which system redesign is likely to be highly effective. With respect to patient \n","127  preference for disposition location, previous studies have emphasized the pervasive time pressures and the frequent inability to fully engage patients and care partners in the ED (Adams et al., 2017; Daniels et al., 2018; Dyrstad et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2018; Pope et al., 2017; Rance et al., 2020; Schechtman et al., 2019; Stuck et al., 2017). Thus, developing and implementing efficient but robust mechanisms to elicit patient preference, such as the guidelines developed by Probst and colleagues, has the potential to greatly influence process performance (Probst et al., 2017). Likewise, as research has previously identified a dearth of patient-related information in the ED (Nelson et al., 2013), it follows that developing an information gathering tool or procedure (e.g., in the EHR) to comprehensively capture pertinent psychosocial factors, making that information readily accessible, would meaningfully influence the ED disposition decision-making process under both low and high demands.   7.4.2 Disparate ratings are representative of meaningful differences in ED work system configuration Although many elements received the same ratings under low and high demand, a subset of work system elements, at least one within each work system component, varied in their rating. The presence of varied rating within each work system component suggests that the ED work system configuration that produces the ED disposition decision-making process under conditions of low and high demand is fundamentally different. Varied perceived elemental influence and overall work system structure indicates that the performance of the ED disposition decision-making process differs under conditions of low and high demand.  Person elements, specifically those related to ED clinician risk tolerance and gestalt, were rated higher under conditions of high demand. The increased reliance on forms of rapid cognitive \n","128  processing is common in the ED generally (Calder et al., 2012; Probst et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2018). As such, it is unsurprising that ED clinicians report these elements as highly influential under conditions of high demand when, arguably, the most challenging attributes of the ED (e.g., time pressure, high ED census) are exacerbated, there is a heightened need to prioritize efficiency, and there is the innate tendency to make strategic decisions to reduce demands (Daniels et al., 2018; Nugus et al., 2011; Shanafelt et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2020). Exceptionally high demands and the subsequent effect they have on ED clinician cognition and decision-making behavior has been associated with poor decision quality (Levin et al., 2006; Shanafelt et al., 2002; Soria-Oliver et al., 2017).   Task elements were generally rated as more influential under conditions of high demand, specifically the elements related to number and complexity of patients and time pressure. The pervasive but variable nature of time pressure and the effect of patient census, specifically of high acuity patients, on ED clinicians’ perception of overall demands is well-studied (Adams et al., 2017; Daniels et al., 2018; Dyrstad et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2018; Pope et al., 2017; Probst et al., 2015; Rance et al., 2020; Schechtman et al., 2019; Stuck et al., 2017). Time pressure is consistently reported as an inherent characteristic of the ED (Rutkowski, Pulia, et al., In progress; Wears et al., 2010). However, the motivation or source of time pressure seems to vary with demand. Under conditions of low demand, ED clinicians have reported attempting to maximize efficiency to reduce workload and ensure the ED is agile enough to respond to a sudden influx of patients (e.g., a mass-casualty event) ( Rutkowski, Pulia, et al., In progress; Shanafelt et al., 2002; Turner et al., 2020). Under conditions of high demand, time pressure seems to be more focused on ethically managing ED census. For instance, in their study exploring ED physician and general medicine physician perspectives on disposition decision-\n","129  making, Daniels and colleagues note “an EM physician went on to explain competing demands in the ED: “If the patient is bordering for going home or coming in, those are the patients that I want to spend the least time on, because that is at the expense of patients who are really sick.” (p. 742)  Tools and technology elements, including both the accuracy and accessibility of information, were rated as more influential under conditions of high demand. This could indicate that under high demands, clinicians rely more heavily on tools and technology to support their work. However, previous work has demonstrated that, due to issues of accuracy and accessibility, ED clinicians are often required to make disposition decisions without sufficient information (Nelson et al., 2013; Stiell et al., 2003). Thus, improving the accuracy and accessibility of information available in the ED has the potential to drastically shape the performance of the disposition decision-making process, specifically under high demands. Two organization elements varied in their ratings between high and low demand. The first was the ability to have comprehensive conversations with patients and/or care partners, which was rated higher under conditions of low demand. Although the disposition decision is not universally conceptualized as a shared decision, barring extenuating circumstances, it would be impossible to make a disposition decision without the input from the patient and/or care partner (Adams et al., 2017; Dyrstad et al., 2015; Probst et al., 2015; Rance et al., 2020; Schechtman et al., 2019). The increased rating of this factor under conditions of low demand could be due to the fact that under low demand, ED clinicians likely have more time to engage in these in-depth conversations and may be attempting to discharge more borderline or “gray-zone” patients (i.e., patients for whom a disposition decision is not immediately obvious), which requires additional coordination (Daniels et al., 2018).  \n","130  The expectation that patients have a well-developed disposition plan in place at the time of shift change was rated higher under conditions of high demand. This could be because under high demands, ED clinicians may be dispositioning patients more quickly and therefore are likely engaging more ED to hospital handoffs. Ensuring the handoff process is effective and efficient is likely paramount to managing demands and optimizing patient flow (Nugus et al., 2011).  The only physical environment element that varied was the patient’s home environment. It was rated as being very or extremely influential under conditions of low demand while only slightly or somewhat influential under conditions of high demands. This could be related to the fact that under conditions of low demand, there is an increased ability to have comprehensive conversations with patients and care partners, an organizational factor that was also rated higher under conditions of low demand. Information about the patient’s home environment is likely to surface during a conversation about follow up care plans, for example.  The two external environment factors that varied with demand were best practice guidelines related to disposition decision-making and the potential for negative consequences should a patient bounceback, which was rated higher under conditions of low and high demands respectively. Previous work has noted the general lack of best practice guidelines, specifically for “grey-zone” patients (Emerson et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Probst et al., 2015). However, it is possible that best practice guidelines were rated higher under conditions of low demand as, under these conditions, ED clinicians likely have more bandwidth to search for and assess the limited guidelines that may exist. The potential for negative consequences (e.g., medicolegal repercussions) should a patient bounceback is likely something that is always a consideration for ED clinicians (Siddique et al., 2018). However, under conditions of high demand it may be more \n","131  of a consideration given that, although they still do their best to provide the highest quality care, ED clinicians have a lessened ability to have in-depth conversations, conduct every potentially insightful lab test, and search for pertinent information. This may make it more likely that an important piece of information is overlooked or a suboptimal disposition decision is selected.  Disparate influence of work system elements under conditions of low and high demand highlights the variability in the influence of ED work system elements on the disposition decision process. Identifying where this variability occurs within the ED work system gives insight into where additional care should be taken when considering system design. The varied level of perceived elemental influence indicates that any intervention is likely to have variable effect on the ED work system structure and thereby process performance, depending on the level of demand. As such, redesign of these work system elements must be adaptive to the varied influence.  For instance, introducing a forcing function or hard stop within the electronic health record (EHR) that requires the deliberate consideration of the patient’s insurance status may be well received under conditions of low demand, where insurance status was perceived as somewhat influential. However, this type of function may be detrimental to disposition decision-making performance under conditions of high demand, where insurance status was perceived to be not influential. Ensuring that proposed system redesigns are compatible with ED clinicians’ perception of element influence will be pertinent to effective intervention and longitudinally sustainable use.   \n","132  7.4.3 Considerations for a modified Delphi approach to configuration  We demonstrated the feasibility of using a modified Delphi approach to produce configural diagrams that represent the same work system for the same process under two conditions. We made strategic study design decisions that led us to achieve favorable outcomes (e.g., 100% response rate on the second survey, short data collection period). As with any study design, there are numerous factors to consider when designing a modified Delphi study.   7.4.3.1 Study design  There are several variables that must be established either a priori or over the course of a modified Delphi study. First, we determined a priori that the study would occur across two rounds of surveys which differs from a tradition Delphi technique which occurs across “n” rounds where “n” is the number of the round where consensus is established (Hsu & Sandford, 2007). Researchers must consider the tradeoffs between a higher proportion of survey elements that achieve consensus and the time-cost and participant fatigue that is likely to occur as the number of rounds increases (Graham, 2010; Hasson et al., 2000; Keeney et al., 2005; McKenna, 1994).  Second, given that there is no agreed-upon standard, when selecting the consensus threshold, it is important to consider the purpose of the study. If the intent of the study is to make an important decision (e.g., update a department policy), a higher threshold may be warranted. If the intent of the study is to make a low-impact decision (e.g., determine tee-shirt color) or assess perceptions, a lower threshold may be appropriate. Our intent with the present study is to assess what most ED clinicians think about the elements that most influence their disposition decision-making process. As such, we selected a consensus threshold of 65%. This threshold permitted \n","133  some consensus latitude and reduced survey burden while allowing us to draw conclusions about the perceptions of the majority of ED clinicians.  7.4.3.2 Data collection   All factors considered, our data collection and analysis processes were seamless, which is atypical for a Delphi approach. Practically, we completed data collection in less than two months and achieved a 100% response rate on the second survey. Delphi approaches are notoriously “time-consuming and laborious” as a result of the “iterative and sequential” nature of the approach (Hasson et al., 2000; Hsu & Sandford, 2007, p. 5; Keeney et al., 2005). Researchers often under-estimate the amount of time needed to administer the initial survey, obtain and analyze the data (e.g., follow up with non-respondents), and develop and distribute subsequent instruments (i.e., achieve consensus) (Hsu & Sandford, 2007; Keeney et al., 2005). Our failure to encounter such time-related barriers could be a result of a few factors. First, we established the number of rounds a priori, which automatically defined a boundary for the amount of data collection that could occur. This strategy allowed us to scope our data collection period to a timeframe that would be reasonable for participants and research team while still preserving the key characteristics of Delphi approaches (Hsu & Sandford, 2007; Powell, 2003).   Second, we sampled a population accustomed to participating in research. Our study occurred within the ED of an academic medical center with an active commitment to research. As such, many of our participants likely had previous experience participating in research and were aware of the expectations, practices, and norms surrounding survey studies. This may have made them more likely to be compliant.  \n","134   Third, both surveys were short (~10 minutes), were smartphone compatible, and contained topics that ED clinicians consider daily. The minimal time commitment, ease of use, and familiarity of the topics likely minimized logistic barriers to participation. Fourth, despite the research team’s best effort, we may have been unable to uphold all four key pillars that define the benefits of the Delphi. With respect to feedback, we had no mechanism to ensure that participants reviewed and integrated the feedback provided into their secondary surveys. We also had no mechanism to ensure complete anonymity. Because we aimed to recruit the entire population, participants were likely aware of other colleagues who were participating in the study. Although we have no reason to believe that participants collaborated, it is possible that participants discussed the surveys with one another (Keeney et al., 2005; McKenna, 1994).  Fifth, it should be noted that “the extent to which participants agree with each other does not mean that consensus exists, nor does it mean that the ’correct’ answer has been found” (Keeney et al., 2005, p. 210). Participants may have all agreed that, in theory, element A is an extremely influential factor in shaping disposition decision-making. However, this may not align with how ED clinicians engage in the disposition decision-making process in their day-to-day work (Keeney et al., 2005). In other words, there may be a misalignment between ED clinicians’ work as imagined (i.e., what ED clinicians ideally do), work as perceived (i.e., what ED clinicians think they do), and work as done (i.e., what ED clinicians actually do) (Leplat, 1989). Future work should consider more just-in-time cognitive approaches (e.g., clinical decision support tools) to assess the elements that acutely shape ED clinicians’ disposition decision-making processes.  \n","135  Sixth, inherently, a Delphi approach conceals dissenting or disparate opinions (Keeney et al., 2005). As part of the consensus building process, participants may have felt inclined to change their responses “because of a possible mistaken belief that the views expressed by the majority of the panel must be right” or “they see that someone else has identified a more relevant issue that they had not thought of” (Keeney et al., 2005, p. 210). As such, although we achieved consensus, our findings may not fully reflect the varied opinions or perspectives of all ED clinicians. Tools like member checking or approaches that honor the variability of individual experiences (e.g., case study, focus groups) could be used to assess the extent to which our findings reflect the full range of ED clinician experiences.   Finally, practically, the default selection in the Qualtrics software was “Not influential” or “1”. Defaults are known to influence participants’ opinions. Participants did still need to click into each question for the question to be marked “complete”. However, the extreme nature of the default selection likely biased participants less than a neutral default (Chimi, 2022).   7.4.3.3 Data analysis  We used a bin approach where each bin represented a set of Likert values (i.e., proportion within a range – unrestricted) (Diamond et al., 2014). The first bin captured the value one which referred to “not influential”. The second bin captured the values two and three which referred to “slightly influential” and “somewhat influential” respectively. The third bin captured the values four and five which referred to “very influential” and “extremely influential” respectively. We delineated the bins in this manner as the interpretation of each bin 1, 2 and 3, and 4 and 5 seemed to represent natural braking points (i.e., slightly and somewhat influential seemed similar, very and extremely seemed similar). We elected to bin our data with the intent of minimizing survey \n","136  burden (i.e., reducing the number of elements included in the second survey by making consensus easier to establish) and reducing clutter on the configural diagrams (i.e., reducing the number of bubble sizes). However, there are other approaches that could be used to analyze the data (e.g., different binning structures, no binning), each of which would influence how consensus is established and how elements are depicted in the configural diagrams. Researchers should consider which approach supports their objectives.  In light of work systems theory, we assumed that all work system elements within the configural diagram interact (Carayon et al., 2006; Carayon et al., 2014; Holden et al., 2013). However, work systems theory suggests that some interactions may be more influential than others on shaping process performance (Holden & Carayon, 2021; Holden et al., 2013). We tended to explore the work system at the elemental level, rather than the interaction level. However, the interconnectedness of work system elements and how those interactions shape process performance is likely substantial. The present study outlines which elements influence the disposition decision-making process and to what extent. Future work should aim to recruit a mechanism (e.g., epistemic network analysis, co-occurrence analysis) to capture and depict why and how elements interact to provide the most robust description of the work system configurations (Weiler et al., 2022).  Configural diagrams generally include lines that connect interacting work system elements. However, previously published papers using configural diagramming, including the paper from which the method originates, do not provide a description of how to strategically position lines to connect interacting elements given that all elements within a work system interact with one another to some extent (Hay et al., 2020; Holden & Carayon, 2021; Holden et al., 2015; Holden et al., 2013; Werner et al., 2020a). In their 2021 paper, Holden and Carayon \n","137  point out that configural “diagrams are not meant to be fully exclusive; they are better suited to show only the most relevant or consequential factors or interactions” (p. 7). Yet, how to determine the most relevant or consequential interactions is still unclear. Thus, to avoid overcomplicating and cluttering our configural diagrams, we did not include lines connecting interacting elements.  With respect to interpretation of the configural diagrams, although we have the ability to influence process performance through targeted intervention motivated by our modified Delphi outputs, there is no guarantee that intervening on a highly influential element will yield exclusively favorable outcomes. Whether favorable outcomes occur due to intervention would depend on the quality of the intervention or redesign and how well it is implemented. The results presented in this study provide us with the anticipated magnitude of influence, not the anticipated outcome of intervention on an influential element.  7.5 Conclusion   Our study extends our understanding of how the ED work system shapes the performance of the disposition decision-making process and also introduces an innovative approach to creating configural diagrams. Practically, our findings have the potential to inform the adaptive and reflexive design of interventions and system structures to support the disposition decision-making. Methodologically, our work expands the work systems analysis toolkit by providing a methodological playbook for configural diagramming, which provides researchers with a mechanism to identify the most influential work systems elements in shaping process performance. The ability to identify these influential elements has the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of work systems research, thereby permitting the translation of \n","138  rigorous work system analyses into actional change that will affect patient, care partner, clinician, and organizational outcomes.   7.7 Chapter 7 references  Adams, E., Goyder, C., Heneghan, C., Brand, L., & Ajjawi, R.

Practically, I aimed to discover which elements most ED clinicians found influential to the ED disposition decision-making process. To do that, I proposed a novel approach to operationalizing configuration – that is the notion that only a subset of all work system elemental interactions is relevant to process performance (Holden et al., 2013). My mixed-methods, staged approach involved the collection and analysis of observation, interview, and survey data to create a robust conceptualization and visualization of work system structures that shape the ED disposition decision-making process.  The outcomes of this dissertation work have both practical and theoretical implications. Practically, my dissertation work defines a set of work system elements that a majority of ED clinicians find influential to the ED disposition decision-making process under low and high demand. With this information, researchers, designers, and leaders can make informed decisions about which questions, interventions, and initiatives are likely to have the greatest influence on the performance of the disposition decision-making process. In other words, the findings from this dissertation provides a list of work system elements that, if redesigned to mitigate barriers or promote facilitators to ED disposition decision-making, would likely have the greatest influence on ED disposition decision-making process performance and related patient, care partner, clinician, and healthcare organizational outcomes. Theoretically, my dissertation work proposes a new approach to perform configural diagramming, a tool used to visualize the configuration of \n","144  a work system. My proposed method lays the foundation for future researchers to rigorously perform configural analysis.  My dissertation consisted of three interdependent studies. First, using a work systems framework, I conducted a scoping literature review of the disposition decision-making literature to assess what was known and where gaps remain in our understanding of the elements that influence the ED disposition decision-making process. This review revealed that many aspects of the ED work system have been previously explored, apart from physical environment. However, none of the reviewed studies comprehensively characterized all aspects of the ED work system nor did they explore the effect of variable conditions on the presentation of work system elements, thereby failing to illuminate the full complexity of the ED work system. Thus, these studies lack the ability to connect the influence of ED work system elements to disposition decision-making process performance and related outcomes, a step that will be necessary to facilitate meaningful system redesign or intervention (Carayon et al., 2006). To begin to fill this gap, I proposed and conducted a two-part exploratory sequential mixed-methods study that aimed to comprehensively identify the factors that shape the ED disposition decision-making process and determine which factors most strongly shape process performance under conditions of low and high demand. To comprehensively identify the factors that shape the performance of the ED disposition decision-making process, I collected rich qualitative data that consisted of contextual inquiry-based observations and critical incident technique (CIT) motivated semi-structured interviews with ED clinicians, patients, and care partners. I analyzed these data using a team-based deductive content analysis guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model.  \n","145  Results from this study revealed that there were 40 work system elements involved in shaping the ED disposition decision-making process. In comparing the results of my work system analysis to the results of my scoping literature review, we can see notable similarities yet key differences (Table 8.1). The two studies identified many of the same work system elements, with the most notable differences seen under the task element. Differences could be an artifact of variances in study design (e.g., data collection, study sites) or study objectives.   Table 8.1: Comparing and contrasting work system elements identified in my literature review and work system analysis Work system component Work system elements Present in literature review?

At least one work system element within each work system component varied in presentation, with the exception of tools and technologies and external environment, which suggests that varied demand have a system-wide influence on the ED work system’s configuration. Under conditions of high demand, ED clinicians reported having insufficient cognitive capacity, physical space, and organizational infrastructure to engaged stakeholders and carry out the ED disposition decision-making process \n","147  in the way that they would prefer. Under conditions of low demand, ED clinicians reported the opposite.   Although my work system analysis was successful in comprehensively characterizing the work system elements that shape the ED disposition decision-making process under conditions of low and high demand, my findings provided limited insight into the extent to which each of the numerous work system elements influence the performance of the disposition decision-making process. Understanding the level of influence each element has on shaping the performance of the disposition decision-making process is key to prioritizing intervention and redesign efforts. Although it would be ideal to optimize each element and elemental interaction through intervention or redesign, it is often unrealistic to do so. Thus, identifying the elements that most strongly shape process performance and thereby, if acted upon, would likely have the greatest influence on outcomes is a necessary next step.   To refine the list of elements identified in the work systems analysis by influence, I conducted configural analysis by means of a modified Delphi approach that surveyed ED attendings, residents, and physician assistants (PA). The pragmatic goal of this study was to determine which work system elements a majority of ED clinicians found to be most influential on the ED disposition decision-making process under conditions of low and high demand. The modified Delphi approach consisted of two staged surveys interspersed with feedback in an effort to promote consensus-building among participants. Ultimately, within each work system component, at least one work system element varied in perceived influence, which suggests that the variations in ED work system structure meaningfully influence process performance at a system-level.   \n","148  8.2 Theoretical contributions  This dissertation proposed a novel method to applying configuration through configural diagrams. Configuration is a concept that has been well-described theoretically in the human factors literature (Holden et al., 2013). However, since the publication of SEIPS 2.0 in 2013, only a handful of papers have attempted to use the concept to guide their research (Carman et al., 2021; Hay et al., 2020; Weiler et al., 2022; Werner et al., 2020). Each paper recruited a slightly different approach to operationalizing configuration and/or configural diagramming. However, how these studies specifically assessed the influence each work system element had on process performance remains unclear. Further, the recent SEIPS 101 paper acknowledged the importance and potential utility of configuration, yet offered no practical methodological guidelines (Holden & Carayon, 2021). As such, without clear guidance on how to assess influence, I developed a novel set of methods to conduct a configural analysis.    8.3 Strengths  This dissertation should be considered in light of a number of strengths both in terms of how the study was conducted and the outputs of the study. With respect to how the study was conducted, I took steps to address the following four pillars of trustworthiness: credibility, transferability, dependability, authenticity (Devers, 1999; Guba & Lincoln, 2001).  To establish credibility, I used methodological and data triangulation, and conducted memoing. Data triangulation involves using more than one data collection method (Robson & McCartan, 2016). I used both interview and questionnaire data. Methodological triangulation involves the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches (Robson & McCartan, 2016). My research used a mixed-methods approach and combined qualitative and quantitative data \n","149  collection and analysis approaches. Further, during data collection and analysis, we also had prolonged engagement with participants and with the data. In the presentation of our findings, we present quotes from multiple participants.  Memoing involves the intentional documentation of ideas, views, and intuitions across all stages of the data collection and analysis process (Robson & McCartan, 2016). Memos contain the output of analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). I memoed across all stages of my work. Memoing allowed me to reflexively document my thoughts, plans, and questions which will guide my future work.   To establish transferability, over the course of data collection, I documented demographic information related to the study setting and participants, so long as it was safe and appropriate to do so. I worked closely with my collaborators to determine the level of detail that is needed to establish transferability without compromising the identity of participants.   To establish dependability, we conducted most data collection and all data analysis in a pair or team setting, with disciplines such as human factors, biomedical engineering and cognitive psychology represented, I documented all research activities and methodological decisions to develop an audit trail, and I provided a rich description of the methods. All data analysis was conducted in pairs (i.e., dual coding) and intermediate interpretations were discussed at weekly team meetings. I documented all research activities and methodological decisions in memos document to establish a retraceable audit trail. Finally, I have and will continue to provide a detailed description of the methods during any presentation or publication of this work.  To establish authenticity, I memoed as described above. I have provided and will continue to provide a rich description of the data analysis and interpretation processes (e.g., how \n","150  data were assessed and how conclusions were drawn) in any presentation or publication of this work. In the analysis and reporting of this work, I have integrated examples and quotations from multiple participants to reflect both the range and consistencies among participants’ experiences.    With respect to the outputs of the study, my findings provide compelling insight into the significant factors that shape the ED disposition decision-making process. My data collection approaches (i.e., observations, semi-structured interviews, modified Delphi) yielded rich, contextualized data that permitted a robust characterization of the ED work system and its influence on the performance of the ED disposition decision-making process. The data generated from this dissertation not only informed meaningful insights on the ED disposition decision-making process but also have the potential to serve as the basis for future secondary analyses to address related research questions (e.g., clinical decision unit admitting behavior, influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disposition decision-making). My staged study design allowed me to maximize the data collected at each stage and strategically use one stage to inform another. My results provide a succinct list of work system elements that, if acted upon, are likely to have the greatest influence on ED disposition decision process performance and outcomes. As such, these data and this research will tangibly inform future emergency medicine research and ED system redesign.    8.4 Limitations  The findings from this dissertation should be considered in light of a number of limitations. Limitations of each individual study can be found in previous chapters (Chapters 5, 6, and 7). In this section, I report overarching limitations that span the entire dissertation and propose future work to address such limitations.  \n","151  First, all data collection took place at the ED of an academic medical center with Level One trauma certification. Due to its academic affiliation, this ED and its employees both conduct and participate in research on a regular basis. This undoubtedly influenced how ED clinician participants thought about the ED disposition decision-making process. As such, it is worth exploring whether ED clinicians at institutions with other characteristics (e.g., critical access, non-academic) have a similar perceptions and experiences as those characterized in this dissertation. This understanding will be necessary as researchers and designers work toward developing interventions and system designs that they intend to be widely implemented to ensure they are sufficiently robust to account for variation among institutions.   Further, the patient population of focus in this dissertation was older adults. Older adults are one of the largest and most vulnerable patient populations who visit the ED, meaning they have the most specialized, demanding or restrictive needs and likely represent the upper bound of patient complexity (Ringer et al., 2018). However, there may be aspects of my findings that are not transferrable to other patient populations. As such, since most ED clinicians practice as generalists, future work may consider exploring whether ED clinicians prioritize the same work system elements for other patient populations. This will ensure that conceptualizations of ED disposition decision-making account for variability that may be present due to unique patient population characteristics.  Second, across all three studies that compose this dissertation, I adhered to the assumption that ED disposition decision-making is a physicians’ process (Dyrstad et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2018; Pope et al., 2017). As such, I largely focused my data collection and analysis efforts on capturing the experience of ED physicians and physician assistants. However, there is compelling evidence, both from the above studies and other studies published in the literature, to \n","152  suggest that ED nurses and other roles (e.g., social work, case management) have a significant role in informing the ED disposition decision-making process (Calder et al., 2012).  Furthermore, my findings point to the importance of communication, coordination, and collaboration during the ED disposition decision-making process. This suggests that ED disposition decision-making is not an individual, internal process localized to the ED physician (Rutkowski et al., 2020). In fact, communication, coordination, and collaboration are hallmarks of teaming (Salas et al., 2008).  In my semi-structured interviews with ED physicians and PAs, some ED clinicians referred to themselves and their colleagues as a “team” while others saw themselves as uniquely distinct from the other roles in the ED. Although the extent to which ED clinicians operate as a team (e.g., verses a group) is debated, some studies have found evidence that teaming occurs during the disposition decision-making process (Probst et al., 2016). Clearly defining the nature of the interactions among the individuals within a system will be necessary to develop tools that support and facilitate communication, coordination, and collaboration.  Third, during the data collection outlined in Chapters 6 and 7, I presented participants with a demand dichotomy. Participants resonated with the description of the ED work system under conditions of high demands. However, many participants found the description of the ED work system under low demands challenging to consider, as most reported that they had not experienced this permutation of the work system recently (due to the pandemic). Although the dichotomy was developed with input from ED clinicians (i.e., the slow concept resonated with some clinicians), it is worth considering whether “low demands” are better conceptualized by a permutation of the ED work system that reflects a “busy but manageable” shift rather than a “slow” shift. Future work could further explore the lived experience of ED clinicians in terms of the demands they experience during this ongoing pandemic period.  \n","153   8.5 Future work  Previous work noted that “if we are seeking to improve the quality of the ED disposition decision, future efforts should focus on better understanding how we arrive at this decision” using “methods such as systems engineering analysis” (Calder et al., 2012, p 574). To address this gap, I used a work systems approach to characterize the work system that influences the ED disposition decision-making process. My findings offer a new lens through which to view the ED disposition decision-making process and the conditions under which it occurs.  At this juncture, a few studies, the present dissertation included, have aimed to characterize different aspects of ED disposition decision-making (Rutkowski et al., In progress). Although these findings offer valuable insight into how ED disposition decision-making occurs and identify notable barriers to process performance, most of these findings are descriptive and have limited capability of informing actionable, sustainable recommendations. As was done with the innovative approach to the diagnostic process, future work should aim to translate these primarily descriptive findings into a robust framework that clearly situates the dynamic ED work system within the ED disposition decision-making process and links the system and process to outcomes (Balogh et al., 2015). Only with this type of framework will we be able to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions and redesign that are predictable, sustainable, and multifaceted (Balogh et al., 2015).  Methodologically, it is important to consider the overall study design and explore whether alternative or additional forms of data or study design could be useful in future studies. This dissertation can be defined as exploratory sequential design in that I first started with rich qualitative data collection (i.e., contextual inquiry-based conversations and semi-structured \n","154  interviews) and transitioned to a quantitative approach (Creswell & Poth, 2016). With contextualized data, I conducted a work systems analysis to identify the elements on which I wanted to survey ED clinicians. I then conducted a modified Delphi survey study, which constituted my quantitative data. This approach allowed me to comprehensively address my research question. However, this study could have benefited from additional quantitative data to determine whether ED clinicians’ perception of the ED disposition process is reflected or supported by data collected in the electronic health record (EHR) (e.g., health history, length of stay, ED census).  For example, in the future, ED clinicians could be sampled in real time to assess whether they perceive the demands of their shift to be low or high. Researchers could then pull key EHR metrics (e.g., ED census, length of stay, chief complaint) known to be associated with key performance and disposition outcomes. This would allow researchers to assess whether ED clinicians’ experiences of high demand are correlated with measurable EHR metrics. Alternatively, taking the present work a step further, both my dissertation and previous research has identified the pervasive lack of disposition guidelines and supportive technology. As such, future research could combine historic EHR data, subject matter expert recommendations, and ED clinician recommendations and experiences to develop an interactive clinical decision support tool that can be used just-in-time during the ED disposition decision-making process. This approach would allow researchers to leverage both large amounts of historic data and insightful anecdotes to develop a tool that minimizes ED clinician cognitive effort and optimizes outcomes.   \n","155  8.6 Conclusion  The ED work system configuration that influences the ED disposition decision-making process varies meaningfully with demands. These variations have the potential to limit the efficacy and utility of interventions, policies, and procedures if not considered during design and implementation. To systematically identify these variations, configural diagramming can be used. As this study has successfully demonstrated, configural diagramming can be systematically implemented through a two-staged methodological approach consisting of a work systems analysis of contextualized qualitative data to comprehensively identify the work system elements that compose the system followed by a modified Delphi approach to elicit the influence each element has on process performance. This can then be used to inform the development of configural diagrams to depict the similarities and differences between two or more conditions of the ED work system. The ability to readily identify similarities and differences between work system structures equips researchers, intervention designers, hospital administrators, and policy makers with the information needed to create solutions that are adaptive and reflexive to the dynamic nature of the ED. Solutions that are adaptive and reflexive are more likely to promote effective, efficient, and safe process performance. Processes that are performed effectively, efficiently, and safely promote optimal patient, care partner, clinician, and hospital organizational outcomes. These optimal outcomes feedback to inform future work system configurations and the performance of processes. In essence, findings from a rigorous configural analysis can inform the development of solutions that lead to positive, sustainable change for critical clinical processes.   8.7 Chapter 8 references   Balogh, E.

Exploring this body of literature is necessary to situate disposition decision-making in the context of the psychological and cognitive theories and principles that underpin the decision. In this section, I review foundational individual and multi-person decision-making frameworks including: Traditional decision-making, Naturalistic decision-making, Transactive memory research, Shared decision-making, and Heuristics.  For clarity and consistency, I have limited my review of multi-person decision-making frameworks to non-team-based models. The term “team” is associated with a very specific definition that often takes the form of “a distinguishable set of two or more people who interact, dynamically, interpedently, and adaptively toward a common and valued goal/objective/mission, who have each been assigned specific roles or functions to perform, and who have a limited life-span of membership” (Salas et al., 1992) Although our understanding of how individuals operate as part of the disposition decision-making process is relatively limited, there is evidence that disposition decision-making does not occur within a tightly-coupled team as defined by the previous definition (Calder et al., 2012; Rutkowski et al., 2020). As such, it seems more appropriate to explore individual and team-ambiguous models of decision-making.  A1.1 Traditional or classical decision-making models   Classical or traditional decision-making models tend to refer to models that predate more modern approaches to decision-making like naturalistic decision-making and heuristics. These approaches are often more logical or analytical in nature. Examples include Bayesian statistics and regression. These approaches were used for decades and provide the foundation for modern \n","159  models of decision-making. However, these approaches have conceptual and applicability challenges.   Foundational decision research focuses primarily on understanding a specific stage of decision-making (i.e., the decision event) (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). In these models, the individual takes an analytical approach to assess a known and fixed set of options, considers likely outcomes of each choice, and makes the decision that is optimal in light of personal goals or values (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). Such assessment usually requires the individual to analyze, score, and weigh all potential alternatives to identify the optimal option which can be complex, time-consuming, and laborious (Albar & Jetter, 2009). Given the limited time, information, and cognitive capacity that characterize most decisions, such approaches have been demonstrated to not accurately reflect how individuals make decisions (Simon, 1956). Although it is useful to have a good understanding of the decision event, limiting the scope of decision-making to just the decision fails to acknowledge that, in most natural settings, the decision is not the ultimate outcome, but rather “decisions are embedded in larger tasks that the decision maker is trying to accomplish” (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). As such, critical social, environmental, organizational, temporal, historical, etc. factors are not considered when exclusively exploring the decision thereby limiting the validity of the findings (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). More progressive models of decision-making, like naturalistic decision-making and shared decision-making, were born out of this systemic misalignment between traditional models of decision-making and observed or lived experience (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993).  A1.2 Naturalistic Decision-making  Naturalistic decision-making (NDM) provides a mechanism to describe how individuals make decisions in context (Klein, 2008). Unlike the previous decades of highly-controlled \n","160  research that aimed to identify low performance, early NDM researchers aimed to identify the strategies that individuals use to make decisions in light of realistic conditions (e.g., high-pressure, constrained, uncertain) (Klein, 2008). Across fields of study, researchers have found that individuals are not curating and evaluating alternatives (Klein, 2008; Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). Instead, individuals are relying on a synthesis of experience (Klein, 2008). NDM facilitated a shift in understanding of decision-making from a domain-independent general approach to a knowledge-based approach (Klein, 2008).  NDM views decision performance in context as the mutual function of task features and the individual’s knowledge and experience relevant to the task (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). There are eight factors that characterize naturalistic decision-making. The extent to which these factors are relevant to a given decision depend on the setting but at least a subset of these factors will be important to consider when exploring decision-making in naturalistic settings. The factors include ill-structured problems, uncertain dynamic environments, shifting or ill-defined or competing goals, action/feedback loops, time stress, high stakes, multiple actors, and organizational goals and norms (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). Numerous models have been developed to conceptualize how these factors manifest within and across various decision processes.  A1.2.1 Individual naturalistic decision-making models  In the early 1990s, Lipshitz identified nine models of NDM that emerged around the same time from various literature domains including Noble’s model of situation assessment, Klein’s model of recognition-primed decisions, Pennington and Hastie’s model of explanation-based decisions, Montgomery’s dominance search model, Beach and Mitchell’s image theory, \n","161  Rasmussen’s model of cognitive control, Hammond’s cognitive continuum theory, Connolly’s model of decision cycles, and Lipshitz’s model of argument-driven action (Lipshitz, 1993).  Lipshitz’s review is not comprehensive of all NDM models that were developed by the 1990s but synthesizes models that were developed to depict “real-world decision-making”, represent a new approach to decision-making (i.e., they do not directly stem from “classical decision theory”), and focused on the individual rather than groups or team (Lipshitz, 1993). A commentary on group decision-making models can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. Below I briefly review each of these nine models.  A1.2.1.1 Noble’s model of Situation Assessment This model addresses how the situation prompting the decision is assessed (Lipshitz, 1993). According to the model, this assessment unfolds across the following steps. First, information about the situation is combined and considered alongside additional contextualizing information (e.g., the broader social climate) and knowledge from the decision maker’s memory (Lipshitz, 1993). The combination of information and knowledge from these sources results in a tentative interpretation, hereby referred to as a representation, of the situation (Lipshitz, 1993). Each representation is associated with certain expectations. These expectations are continually compared to how the situation is actually unfolding and the representation is retained, refined, or replaced with a new representation that then undergoes the same testing and then is either retained, refined, or replaced (Lipshitz, 1993).  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, the process of continually updating one’s representation of situations as they unfold seems to parallel how ED physicians receive and interpret information over the course of the ED visit. ED physicians obtain information from a variety of sources (e.g., the patient, diagnostic tests, other providers) over the course of the ED \n","162  visit (Rutkowski et al., 2020). With each piece of new information, the ED provider is likely to either retain, refine, or replace their representation. With respect to application in the field, Nobel’s model appears to have relatively limited use in research and instead has been used in the development of software to assess complex situations (Lipshitz, 1993).  In summary, Noble’s model of situation assessment may be able to provide some value to understanding disposition decision-making but its limited use in varied research settings may make it difficult to determine the extent of its utility. A1.2.1.2 Klein’s model of Recognition-Primed Decisions Klein’s descriptive model of recognition-primed decision-making explores how proficient decision makers operate effectively under high stress and time pressure (Klein, 2008; Lipshitz, 1993). Through his work studying fireground commanders, Klein found that, unlike the traditional belief that decision-making involves selection among alternatives, proficient decision makers assessed the current situation and selected an appropriate action (Lipshitz, 1993). Recognition-primed decision-making consists of three phases: situation recognition, serial option evaluation, and mental simulation (Lipshitz, 1993).  Situation recognition involves the decision maker recognizing or classifying the situation as typical or unique (Lipshitz, 1993). To do this, the decision maker identifies cues that indicate the situation type and consider causal factors that describe what is happening and what will happen (Lipshitz, 1993). By focusing only on critical information and causal factors, the proficient decision maker reduces information overload, minimizes confusion, and establishes realistic expectations (Lipshitz, 1993). From this assessment, the decision maker sets goals and selects an appropriate action (Lipshitz, 1993).  \n","163  Serial option evaluation involves the decision maker evaluating action alternatives individually until one is identified that satisfies the current situation (Lipshitz, 1993). Action options are considered from a queue of potential actions that are prioritized according to what is most typical based on identifiable patterns from previous experience (Klein, 2008; Lipshitz, 1993). The prioritization based on typicality allows the decision maker to match the situation to an action quickly and efficiently (Klein, 2008; Lipshitz, 1993). In his work, Klein found that if the decision maker identified an action that they could readily initiate, they would move forward with that action even if it was not optimal (Klein, 2008). The process of identifying the first option that is satisfactory is referred to as satisficing (Klein, 2008).  Mental simulation involves the decision maker evaluating if an action is satisfactory by simulating the actions and potential outcomes, problems, and solutions in their mind (Lipshitz, 1993). Based on this simulation, the decision maker either moves forward with the action, makes modifications, or discards it and proceeds to simulate the next action in the queue (Lipshitz, 1993). During this stage, the decision maker may reassess the situation to identify previously unnoticed aspects of the situation (Lipshitz, 1993). This phase prevents and mitigates mistakes that would likely result from a less rigorous decision-making process (Lipshitz, 1993).  Klein has noted that his recognition-primed decision model is most suitable for proficient decision makers (i.e., those with expertise and experience) who make decisions under time pressure and are not required to optimize or justify the decision, and where the decisions are naturally presented as discrete choices (Klein, 2008). Thus, the model describes how individuals can make rapid and good decisions without comparing options (Klein, 2008). The recognition-primed decision model combines intuition (i.e., System 1 thinking) with analysis (i.e., System 2 thinking). This is critical as exclusively relying on the intuitive approach of pattern matching \n","164  could result in flawed options. Likewise, exclusively relying on the analytic approach of considering all options in turn would be too slow to be useful in an acute situation (Klein, 2008). The integration of these two approaches makes the recognition-primed decision model realistic yet comprehensive.  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, although the ED represents a complex and often time-pressured environment, when it comes to disposition decision-making, ED physicians do not necessarily make extremely time-pressured decisions moment by moment for patients with less acute illness or injuries (Stiell et al., 2003; Wears & Leape, 1999; Wears et al., 2010). Further, ED physicians may be required to clearly justify the disposition decision, meaning that satisficing likely is not a part of decision process.  In summary, Klein’s model of recognition-primed decisions most likely does not completely reflect the disposition decision-making process. A1.2.1.3 Pennington and Hastie’s Explanation-Based Decisions Pennington and Hastie’s story-based model of explanation-based decisions was developed to understand how individual jurors make decisions but has since been expanded to be a more general decision-making model (Lipshitz, 1993). The explanation-based decision model consists of three phases which correspond to the three phases of a trial: processing the evidence, defining the verdict alternatives, and determining the verdict (Lipshitz, 1993).  Processing the evidence consists of the decision maker organizing fragmented, often conflicting information into a coherent story (Lipshitz, 1993). Where there are gaps in the decision maker’s story, the decision maker infers actions, mental states, and consequences to increase the coherence of the story (Lipshitz, 1993). The story reveals the underlying episode \n","165  schema which consists of initiating events, physical states, psychological states, goals, actions, and consequences which are connected either temporally or causally (Lipshitz, 1993).  Defining verdict alternatives consists of an organizational leader (e.g., a judge) outlining and defining the conditions for a discrete set of potential outcomes (e.g., different verdict options) for the decision maker to consider (Lipshitz, 1993). Finally, determining the verdict consists of the decision maker identifying which outcomes (e.g., verdicts) best align with the story the decision maker constructed from the evidence (Lipshitz, 1993). According to this model, the decision maker will only select an option if it aligns with the story they have previously constructed (Lipshitz, 1993).  Pennington and Hastie noted that the explanation-based decision model is a unique depiction of how decisions are made when individuals must process a large amount of information that is incomplete, fragmented, and presented in a non-temporal sequence (Lipshitz, 1993). They suggest that individuals cope with this suboptimal presentation of information by constructing a causal explanation (i.e., a story) based on the information provided, general knowledge, and inferences (Lipshitz, 1993). This model is most useful for characterizing tasks or domains where stories or storytelling is central (e.g., a legal trial).  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, Pennington and Hastie’s story-based model of explanation-based decisions may be useful in more richly understanding disposition decision-making and more clearly situating disposition decision-making into the patient journey. One could argue that the patient journey could be conceptualized as a “story” that unfolds over an extended period of time (Carayon et al., 2020). Thus, a story-based framework may provide sufficient infrastructure to capture micro stories that occur within the macro story (i.e., the patient journey). For example, a story-based approach could be useful in understanding how an \n","166  ED physician interprets information provided by the patient and family. ED physicians often ask open-ended questions like “tell me what brought you in today” which gives the patient a chance to tell their “story.” However, patient’s perceptions of the events that preceded their ED visit are often fraught with inconsistencies, are presented in a fragmented manner, and represent only the information the patient is willing and able to communicate. As a result, the ED physician is likely to infer actions, mental states, and outcomes to develop a cohesive story of events.   Further, there are a limited number of disposition locations. For example, usually patients are transferred to an inpatient unit, a clinical decision unit, an outpatient skilled care facility, or home. As such, providers must select a disposition location that best “matches” with the story they have developed over the course of the patient’s ED visit.  Despite its potential benefits, the model has yet to be validated in a healthcare setting. However, this model and story-based models warrant further exploration to determine their suitability for supporting a deeper understanding of disposition decision-making. A1.2.1.4 Montgomery’s Search for Dominance Structure  The search for dominance structure model captures decisions for which there are several alternatives (Lipshitz, 1993). Montgomery suggested that individuals would search for a dominant alternative which is defined as the alternative that is at least as attractive as competitors on all pertinent attributes and exceeds each on at least one attribute (Lipshitz, 1993). According to this model, the pursuit for a dominant alternative consists of four phases where the decision maker recruits different decision rules (Lipshitz, 1993). The four phases are pre-editing, finding a promising alternative, dominance testing, and dominance structuring.  Pre-editing consists of the decision maker selecting the attribute that will guide the decision-making process (Lipshitz, 1993). These criteria define factors that are important to the \n","167  decision maker and will be used to identify obviously unfavorable alternatives (i.e., the conjunctive decision rule) (Lipshitz, 1993). Finding a promising alternative consists of the decision maker selecting an alternative that appears to best align with the attribute defined in the pre-editing phase (i.e., disjunctive decision rule) (Lipshitz, 1993). Dominance testing consists of the decision maker testing the promising alternative against the criteria of dominance. If the criteria align, the alternative is selected. If the criteria do not align, the decision maker moves on to the dominance structure phase (Lipshitz, 1993).  Dominance structure involves the decision maker reinterpreting the standing of the promising alternative relative to the other options to make it a dominant alternative (Lipshitz, 1993). This is done by deemphasizing the chance that a suboptimal attribute of the promising alternative will occur, enhancing the significance of attributes on which the promising alternative is superior through realistic examples, assessing the tradeoffs between the positives of one attribute and negatives of another attribute, and integrating multiple attributes into a composite attribute (Lipshitz, 1993).  In essence, Montgomery conceptualizes decision-making as the process of rationalizing certain decisions and behaviors by quickly identifying a promising alternative and then affirming the dominance of this alternative (Lipshitz, 1993). Montgomery suggests that this approach to decision-making is representative of human’s limited capacity for information processing in that focusing on a set of alternatives and evaluating those alternatives by a set of attributes allows individuals to identify the preferred alternative (Lipshitz, 1993). Further, identifying and justifying a dominant alternative affords the decision maker confidence during implementation in light of altering circumstances, ambiguous goals, and competing interests (Lipshitz, 1993). As with the recognition-primed decision model, the search for dominance structure model combines \n","168  intuition with deeper analysis thereby allowing decision makers to identify a viable option quickly (Lipshitz, 1993). However, due to the reinterpretation of available information, the search for the dominance structure model may lead to the decision maker distorting reality in favor of justifying a potentially suboptimal but preferred option (Lipshitz, 1993).  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, disposition decision-making involves the selection among a limited number of alternatives based on a set of factors determined by the ED physician and/or the patient (e.g., must be dispositioned to a location where a high-level of support is available). However, the extent to which ED physicians would prospectively justify or rationalize their promising alternative by deemphasizing the chance that a suboptimal attribute of the promising alternative will occur, enhancing the significance of attributes on which the promising alternative is superior, assessing the tradeoffs between the positives of one attribute and negatives of another attribute, and integrating multiple attributes into a composite attribute is unclear. Providers may be asked to justify their decisions in the case of an investigation into a negative outcome. However, it is unclear the extent to which this pending requirement for justification influences practice, specifically disposition decision-making.  In summary, Montgomery’s dominance search model may be useful in further understanding how disposition decision-making occurs. However, further investigation is needed to determine the extent to which ED physicians engage in this process of justification and rationalization. A1.2.1.5 Beach and Mitchell’s Image Theory Image theory was developed from over a decade of work studying real-life decisions across a range of domains (Lipshitz, 1993). The theory consists of four components: images, adoption decisions, progress decisions, and frames. Images refer to the cognitive structures or \n","169  schemata that order the decision maker’s knowledge and values, and guide decisions (Lipshitz, 1993). Images can be categorized into three types. The first type is the value image which consists of the decision maker’s notions about what is “right” and “wrong” and the ideals to which they aim (i.e., their principles) (Lipshitz, 1993). The second is the trajectory image which consists of tangible goals that the decision maker aims to achieve (Lipshitz, 1993). The third is the strategic image which consists of the steps and behaviors needed to achieve the goal (i.e., plans and tactics) and the anticipated outcomes associated with enacting a plan (i.e., forecasts) (Lipshitz, 1993).  Adoption decisions refer to the integration of goals and plans to realize the decision maker’s current agenda (Lipshitz, 1993). This process consists of a compatibility test that assesses the extent to which a proposed goal or plan aligns with the decision maker’s three images (Lipshitz, 1993). The goal of the compatibility test is to quickly eliminate misaligned goals and plans (Lipshitz, 1993). If more than one proposed goal or plan passes the compatibility test, the decision maker then conducts a profitability test (Lipshitz, 1993). The phrase “profitability test” refers to a range of tests stemming from more intuitive methods (i.e., those that require minimal time and effort) to analytic tests (i.e., those that require a greater time and effort investment), and can either be compensatory (i.e., permitting advantages of an option to balance the disadvantages) or non-compensatory (Lipshitz, 1993). Most decisions are made using a compatibility test, but the decision maker may deem a profitability tests necessary (Lipshitz, 1993). In such cases, the profitability testing process often unfolds across the following four stages:   1. The decision maker is unable to make a decision based on the compatibility test. \n","170  2. The decision maker tends to view the compatibility and profitability tests independently. In other words, decision makers often disregard the information they used during compatibility testing as they make a decision based on the findings from the profitability test.  3. As decision complexity increases so does the decision maker’s tendency to recruit more intuitive and non-compensatory profitability tests.  4. Decision makers use different profitability tests to make acceptable decisions with limited effort investment (Lipshitz, 1993).  Progress decisions help the decision maker envision and simulate the proposed plan and evaluate whether a plan, if implemented, will achieve its goals (Lipshitz, 1993). Progress decisions occur during compatibility testing. If the decision maker envisions a plan and determines that it is likely to synergize with the trajectory and strategic images, the plan is added to the strategic images (Lipshitz, 1993). If the decision maker determines that the plan is likely to conflict with the existing trajectory and strategic images, the plan may be revised and adopted or replaced by another option (Lipshitz, 1993). Likewise, if the decision maker determines that the plan will address the goals, the decision maker will adopt the plan with no revision (Lipshitz, 1993). If the decision maker determines that the plan is unlikely to address the goals, they will either revise the plan or the goals (Lipshitz, 1993).  A frame refers to the subset of the decision maker’s principles, goals, and plans that most influence the decision (Lipshitz, 1993). At a given point in time, the frame represents the accepted norms (Lipshitz, 1993). All other factors being equal, image theory suggests that decision makers have a tendency to accept existing plans and goals over potential alternatives (Lipshitz, 1993).  \n","171  Relative to the other models explored in this section, image theory most clearly integrates the decision maker’s individual values and ideals thereby indicating that decisions are not always pursued to achieve a desired outcome but rather to operationalize individual values and ideals (Lipshitz, 1993).  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, although there may be some aspects of Beach and Mitchell’s Image Theory that could be useful in understanding disposition decision-making, there are a number of model components that do not clearly map to disposition decision-making. Specifically, images are developed from an individual’s knowledge and values and reflect the individual’s principles, goals, and plans. However, identifying an ED physicians’ principles may pose a challenge. Most ED providers are likely to share broad goals like optimize patient safety, but principles specific disposition decision-making may be more difficult to elicit. Further, what an ED physician believes about “right” and “wrong” with respect to disposition decision-making may misalign with what the patient and family believe about disposition decision-making. Excluding instances of involuntary hospitalization, the ED physicians’ principals may be ultimately overridden by those of patients and care partners.  Further, Image Theory relies on the individual’s ability to envision and simulate the proposed plan and evaluate whether a plan, if implemented, will achieve its goals (Lipshitz, 1993). However, it may be difficult for ED physicians to fully consider the implications of dispositioning a patient to one location over another as there is often uncertainty about the type and quality of care a patient will receive in different settings (Werner et al., Under review). In summary, these misalignments likely render Beach and Mitchell’s Image Theory less useful for understanding disposition decision-making. \n","172  A1.2.1.6 Rasmussen’s Cognitive Control of Decision Processes  The cognitive control of decision processes model depicts the decision-making processes of individuals who operate in complex and automated systems (e.g., nuclear power plants) and can help in understanding and reducing the likelihood of “human errors” (Lipshitz, 1993). The model consists of three behavior types: skill-based behavior, rule-based behavior, and knowledge-based behavior.  Skill-based behavior includes expert sensorimotor performance which can occur seamlessly without conscious attention (Lipshitz, 1993). This behavior is controlled by a dynamic mental model that captures the decision maker’s movements and environment continually which enables the decision maker to make adjustments to feedback in real time (Lipshitz, 1993). Mental models are a combination of a person’s expectations, experiences, and perceptions of a given system (Mathieu et al., 2000; Norman, 1983). Signals (i.e., inputs) serve as the catalyst to action without explicit consideration of the significance of the input or the decision makers’ goals (Lipshitz, 1993).  Rule-based behavior refers to behavior that is dictated by rules and knowing how to do something in a way that the decision maker can clearly articulate (Lipshitz, 1993). Signals are processed as indicators for a certain type of situation and subsequent behavior is guided by previous experience or formal training (Lipshitz, 1993). In other words, rule-based behavior involves recognition of signs that then lead to certain behavior (i.e., cue-task association). Both skill-based behavior and rule-based behavior are associated with expert performance in familiar situations (Lipshitz, 1993).  Knowledge-based behavior results in effective action guided by a rich understanding of the situation and clear consideration of objectives and alternatives in novel situations (Lipshitz, \n","173  1993). Signals are processed as symbols meaning they are used to construct mental models depicting causal and operational relationships in the environment (Lipshitz, 1993). These models are constructed across varied dimensions of abstraction and decomposition. The abstraction dimension refers to the notion that individuals who operate technological systems sometimes focus on tangible and visible aspects of the system, and at other times they focus on abstract properties such as information flow within a system and the system’s general purpose (Lipshitz, 1993). The decomposition dimension refers to the notion that individuals sometimes focus on specific components of the system and at other times focus on larger system components or the system itself (Lipshitz, 1993).  In summary, Rasmusssen’s cognitive control of decision processes model gives insight into whether and to what extent individuals operate out of habit, which can then be used to determine how and why accidents occur. Further, identifying the type of behavior an individual is conducting gives insight into the type of decision support systems that would be appropriate and effective. For example, a structural diagram would be useful for identifying a broken component but would not be useful in discerning the component’s intended purpose (Lipshitz, 1993). As it pertains to disposition decision-making, because disposition decision-making is often a lengthy process that consists of numerous tasks, Rasmussen’s model may be able to provide insight into how and why ED physicians behave at various points in the ED visit (Medicine, 2008). For example, across an ED visit and throughout the disposition decision-making process, a provider may engage in all three types of behavior. However, this model focuses more on external behavioral cues to decision-making and provides little insight into the person factors that influence the decision. Further, given the behavioral focus of the model, it \n","174  may not be comprehensive enough to capture all aspects of the disposition decision-making process.  A1.2.1.7 Hammond’s Task Characteristics and Human Cognition  Hammond’s work, which aimed to fully explicate and expand upon Brunswik’s probabilistic functionalism, is considered an extension of social judgement theory (SJT) (Cooksey, 1996; Lipshitz, 1993). SJT aims to understand human judgement as it occurs in certain ecological contexts (Cooksey, 1996). SJT details the relationship among the task system, the information available on this task system, the perception and integration of this information, and the resulting judgements and decisions (Lipshitz, 1993). Hammond was particularly interested in addressing the following questions: (1) to what extent are decisions made intuitively verses analytically and (2) do decision makers seek patterns or functional relationships to address the situation? (Lipshitz, 1993).  To address the first question, Hammond proposed that the cognitive processes that inform decision-making can be situated on a cognitive continuum ranging from intuitive to analytical. This process continuum is known as the cognitive continuum index (CCI) (Lipshitz, 1993). According to Hammond, determining where a process should be located on this continuum is a function of two factors (Lipshitz, 1993). First, individuals are often more analytical when rapid or “snap” judgements fail and are often more intuitive when detailed analysis fails (Lipshitz, 1993). Second, the nature of tasks influences decision-making (Lipshitz, 1993). The inducement principle suggest that particular task characteristics led to more intuitive behavior while others lead to more analytical behavior. As such, just as cognitive processes can be situated on a continuum, tasks can be situated on a continuum ranging from inducing more or less intuition or analysis. This tasks continuum is known as the task continuum index (TCI) (Lipshitz, 1993).  \n","175  Hammond’s inducement principle describes why individuals waiver between intuitive and analytical cognitive decision-making processes as tasks characteristics change (Lipshitz, 1993). Further, Hammond’s correspondence-accuracy principle suggests that decision-making is most effective when there is alignment between the location of the cognitive process on the CCI and the task on the TCI (Lipshitz, 1993). Therefore, changes in the tasks will lead to predictable changes in cognitive processes (Lipshitz, 1993).  The address the second question, Hammond suggests that task characteristics lead to either patterns or functional relations in the situation (Lipshitz, 1993). Pattern seeking is likely to occur if the situation is associated with highly organized information and if the individual must be able to articulate a clear explanation of events or situations (Lipshitz, 1993). Functional relations seeking is likely to occur if the situation is associated with unorganized information and if the individual must be able to provide descriptions or predictions (Lipshitz, 1993).  In summary, Hammond’s work suggests that decisions and decision-making are seldom exclusively intuitive or analytic. Rather, decision-making occurs dynamically between intuition and analysis as a result of task characteristics, indicating the importance of exploring the task characteristics.  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, preliminary work has explored the extent to which disposition decisions involve Systems 1 (i.e., intuitive) verses Systems 2 (i.e., analytic) thinking (Cabrera et al., 2015; Sibbald et al., 2017; Wiswell et al., 2013). This work has produced varied findings but overall suggest that there may be elements of Systems 1 and Systems 2 thinking involved in disposition decision-making. Therefore, a decision-making model that integrates the historic utility of intuition verses analysis to an individual as well as the type of cognitive processes that tasks elicit could be useful in understanding how ED physicians \n","176  oscillate between intuition and analysis over the course of the disposition decision-making process. However, given that the focus of this model is primarily on the individual decision-maker, it may not be comprehensive enough to capture all aspects of the disposition decision-making process. A1.2.1.8 Connolly’s Decision Cycles  Connolly suggests that decision-making must consist of continual interaction among situation assessment, evaluation of alternatives, and subsequent action as the process of decision-making in context is dynamic (Lipshitz, 1993). The Decision Cycle model consists of three domains (i.e., the actual world, the decision maker’s cognitive map, and the decision maker’s values, goals, and purposes) and two cycles (i.e., perceptual cycle and decisional cycle). The perceptual cycle involves feedback from action consequences adjusting the decision maker’s cognitive map, which motivates future action (Lipshitz, 1993). The decisional cycle involves feedback from action consequences adjusting the decision maker’s goals (Lipshitz, 1993).  To more clearly distinguish between acting and thinking, Connolly defines two decision processes: action-last or tree-felling and action-first or hedge-clipping (Lipshitz, 1993). Tree-felling refers to consequential decisions that are made in a single step following a planning period with well-defined goals and are associated with tangible next steps (Lipshitz, 1993). Hedge trimming refers to decisions that are made across a series of steps. Hedge trimming is useful when it is difficult to determine a clear goal and when outcomes of individual actions are minimal (Lipshitz, 1993).  To better understand the interaction among the three domains and the two levels of decision cycles, Connolly suggest using decision paths (Lipshitz, 1993). Decision paths are guided by the clarity of decision maker’s values and goals. Individuals with clear goals may \n","177  focus on perceptual exploration, which will involve determining what actions best satisfy their goals (Lipshitz, 1993). Individuals with ill-defined goals may focus on evaluative exploration, which will involve more broadly considering the benefit of one action over another (Lipshitz, 1993).   As it pertains to disposition decision-making, the interaction among the actual world, an individual’s cognitive map, and an individual’s values, goals, and purposes across perpetual cycles and decision cycles may be able to provide insight into the evolution of a disposition decision over the course of an ED visit. Because of the interactions and feedback loops, relative to the other models presented here, Connolly’s model of decision cycles may be able to supplement systems models like the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model (Carayon et al., 2006). Integrating Connolly’s model of decision cycles with SEIPS, for example, would allow the decision-making process to be embedded within the work system thereby giving a more detailed description of both the decision-making process and the context within which the process occurs. However, on its own, Connolly’s model may not be comprehensive enough to capture all aspects of the disposition decision-making process. A1.2.1.9 Lipshitz’s Decision-Making as Argument-Driven Action model  Lipshitz conceptualizes decision-making as argument-driven action and suggests that this could occur through three different modes: consequential choice, matching, and reassessment (Lipshitz, 1993). Lipshitz suggests that these three modes of decision-making differ across six attributes of decision processes: framing, form, uncertainty, logic, handicaps, and therapies. Framing refers to how the decision problem is described (Lipshitz, 1993). Form refers to how an action is determined (Lipshitz, 1993). Uncertainty refers to the questions that must be addressed to act (Lipshitz, 1993). Handicaps refer to the obstacles that effect the ability to make quality \n","178  decisions (Lipshitz, 1993). Therapies refer to the mechanisms of improvement that are compatible with the previous five attributes (Lipshitz, 1993).     Consequential choice refers to selecting an option among alternatives in terms of expected outcome (Lipshitz, 1993). Consequential choice problems are often framed as prospective choices (e.g., there are several options available, which has the best outcomes?) (Lipshitz, 1993). The form of the decision process involves comparing alternatives. Uncertainty relates to the likelihood and preferability of the potential outcomes (Lipshitz, 1993). The logic is teleological in that it is purpose-driven as opposed to causally descriptive. The teleological logic reflects the notion that individuals act wisely when they consider the future and plan (Lipshitz, 1993). A key handicap is individual’s limited information processing capacity. Therapies to address this handicap include interventions develop using formal models of optimal choice and judgment under uncertain conditions (Lipshitz, 1993).  Matching refers to identifying an action based on its appropriateness to the situation (Lipshitz, 1993). Problems are framed as situational assessment during which questions like “what should be done in this situation?” are asked (Lipshitz, 1993). The form of the decision process involves reliance on personal experience, professional standards, and social norms. Uncertainty refers to unknowns related to the situation or the actions required (Lipshitz, 1993). The logic is deontological in that it relies on the perspective that actions can be classified as good or bad (or right or wrong) based on whether they are consistent with moral duties (Lipshitz, 1993). The deontological logic reflects notion that individuals act wisely when they refer to their experiences or others’ experiences (Lipshitz, 1993). Therapies include the use of training and expert or production systems (Lipshitz, 1993).  \n","179  Reassessing refers to reviewing the appropriateness of an action due to objections of its implementation (Lipshitz, 1993). Problems are framed as oppositions to particular courses of action due to uncertain present or future circumstances (Lipshitz, 1993). A discussion of form is null in that the individual has already committed to a decision (Lipshitz, 1993). The logic is nonjustificational in that it reflects the notion that forethought is not feasible, acting precedes thinking, and the best any individual can hope for is the ability to critically reflect on one’s values and assumptions (Lipshitz, 1993). A key handicap is a lack of thorough implementation due to previous decisions or wishful thinking (Lipshitz, 1993). Therapies include methods for promoting critical thinking (Lipshitz, 1993).  In summary, Lipshitz emphasizes that conceptualizing decisions as a selection among alternatives oversimplifies the complex process that most individuals experience. Lipshitz suggests that a more appropriate, generalizable conceptualization is that every action can be justified by a reason. This is generalizable in that action and the reason differ by type of decision process in with an individual engages.  As it pertains to disposition decision-making, Lipshitz’s model is much more prescriptive relative to the other models. Although a prescriptive approach is necessary when considering how to address many of the challenges associated with disposition decision-making, a more descriptive approach may be better in light of the relatively limited information available about how disposition decision-making occurs. A1.2.2 Group naturalistic decision-making models Orasanu and Salas determined that an NDM approach could be useful in understanding decision-making involving more than one individual (Orasanu & Salas, 1993). They note that many decisions are made my teams or groups and that “even if a single individual bears \n","180  responsibility for the decision, many participants contribute to the final product” (Orasanu & Salas, 1993, p. 327). They define team decision-making as the “process of reaching a decision undertaken by interdependent individuals to achieve a common goal” (Orasanu & Salas, 1993, p. 328). They note that team decision-making differs from individual decision-making in that team decision-making involves more than one source of information and that the task perspectives of the involved individuals must be combined to achieve a decision (Orasanu & Salas, 1993). They also suggest that, although individuals appear to have the same goal, team members may have disparate agendas, motive, perceptions, and opinions that must be reconciled (Orasanu & Salas, 1993).  Although many of these comments seem as though they have the potential to apply to disposition decision-making, Orasanu and Salas adhere to a traditional definition of “team”. They define a team by the following characteristics: two or more individuals, more than on sources of information, interdependence and coordination among members, adaptive management of internal resources, common valued goals, defined roles and responsibilities, and task relevant knowledge (Orasanu & Salas, 1993). As such, their discussion of team-based NDM lies outside of the scope of this review.  A1.2.3 Advantages and disadvantages to a naturalistic decision-making approach The aforementioned models represent an exemplary subset of NDM models that depict varying applications of the eight characteristics of NDM described in section 2.2.2. Overall, an NDM approach has the potential to support a richer understanding of disposition decision-making in that NDM aims to fundamentally capture decisions in context. This drive to capture context supports the reality decisions are engrained in larger tasks (or processes) that an individual aims to accomplish (Orasanu & Connolly, 1993). With this recognition, NDM \n","181  approaches decision-making, not as an independent occurrence that represents an endpoint, but rather as a dynamic process that prompts subsequent action and is deeply connected to the environment within which the individual operates. However, many NDM models have not been validated in healthcare and, as described in section 2.2.2.1, are likely unable to fully describe disposition decision-making.  A1.3 Transactive memory research  A1.3.1 Definition and conceptual underpinning of transactive memory  Transactive memory is the notion that individuals who operate within close proximity experience cognitive interdependence such that their thoughts are closely interconnected (Wegner, 1987). This allows the dyad or group to consider or produce ideas that any one individual would not be able to produce alone (Wegner et al., 1985). As such, exploring transactive memory allows for the “prediction of group and individual behavior through an understanding of the manner in which groups process and structure information” (Wegner, 1987, p. 185). A transactive memory system, then, involves the interaction or “operation of the memory systems of individuals and the processes of communication that occur within the group” (Wegner, 1987, p. 191).  Transactive memory and transactive memory systems are conceptually grounded in understandings of the individual memory system (Wegner, 1987). The individual memory system can be conceptualized through the understanding of three interconnected concepts: internal memory, metamemory, and external memory (Wegner, 1987). Within internal memory, individuals encode information, store information, and retrieve information. Encoding involves the intake and labeling of information (Wegner, 1987). Storage involves the categorizing and \n","182  linking of encoded information such that it can be later called upon (Wegner, 1987). Retrieval involves calling upon stored information (Wegner, 1987).  Metamemory captures an individual’s assessment of or beliefs about their own memory facilities (Wegner, 1987). In other words, metamemory describes what an individual believes to be true about what they “know” and “do not know”. An individual with a comprehensive metamemory will have a realistic grasp of what they know (i.e., no additional information seeking is required) and what they do not know (i.e., additional information seeking is required) (Wegner, 1987). Metamemory allows an individual to assess whether a piece of information or a set of information pieces can be found within one’s own memory (Wegner, 1987).  External memory, which also adheres to the encoding, storage, and retrieval processes, describes the out-of-mind record-keeping tendencies most individuals possess (Wegner, 1987). External storage can be both used as a proximal aid (e.g., remembering an upcoming event) and to store large amounts of information that could not be retrieved elsewhere (e.g., from internal storage) (Wegner, 1987). As an example, external memory may involve knowing where to find information as opposed to keeping the information itself in internal memory.  Just as individuals encode, store, and retrieve information, transactive memory networks (e.g., groups) are able to encode, store, and retrieve information in their own way (Wegner, 1987). For example, within a group, encoding and storing may involve designating one individual to remember a certain piece of information. This usually involves discussion of incoming information and a negotiation of where and in what form the information should be stored (Wegner, 1987). As a result, as the name implies, transactive memory cannot be attribute to any one individual or subset of individuals but rather is an emergent property of the group (Wegner, 1987). In summary, Wegner describes transactive memory as being derived “from \n","183  individuals to form a group information-processing system that eventually may return to have profound influence upon its individual participants” (Wegner, 1987, p. 191).   The benefits of transactive memory to each involved individual are significant. As a part of a transactive memory network and through the development of a transactive system, an individual’s expertise is enriched and expanded (Wegner, 1987). Further, the specialized knowledge that each individual develops as a part of the system is of value to everyone (Wegner, 1987). Individuals not only gain access to one another’s domain knowledge but also gain access to the knowledge that is curated through the integration of expertise within the transactive memory (Wegner, 1987).  Beyond the information itself, groups with high functioning transactive memory are able to encode and store relevant information that any one individual would miss (Wegner, 1987). In the same way, an individual’s capacity to process information and make decisions is expanded in that others can complete these processes while the individual is preoccupied or unavailable (Wegner, 1987). Groups with operational transactive memories are likely to effectively achieve their goals and satisfy their members (Wegner, 1987). By the nature of their construction, transactive memory systems promote the creation of transactive memory among individuals that would otherwise not operate jointly as part of a group (Wegner, 1987).  Despite the potential benefits, transactive memory has some disadvantages. The distribution of knowledge and expertise among individuals can cause confusion, error, and strain on an individual’s information processing capacities (Wegner, 1987). For example, if there is confusion or dispute regarding each individual’s domain of expertise, the responsibility for certain types of knowledge may be unclear and lead to relevant information being unencoded and forgotten (Wegner, 1987). Further, just as an individual develops metamemory relating to their \n","184  own knowledge, a transactive memory system offers individuals information about what knowledge is available within the group (Wegner, 1987). Although potentially beneficial, this metamemory can result in an overconfidence in one’s abilities to access knowledge. This overconfidence can render one’s own contribution of information useless and lead to poor decision-making (Wegner, 1987).  When a group disbands, individuals, who were accustomed to operating interdependently to encode, store, and retrieve information, are left with incomplete components for the former transactive system (Wegner, 1987). For example, information about where to locate information is no longer relevant. The codes for information used among group members are often uninterpretable to others. Even pieces of information may lose value and effect an individual’s ability to develop an independent individual memory if an individual was only storing them exclusively for the transactive memory (Wegner, 1987).  A1.3.2 Implications of transactive memory in healthcare  Although simplified to three levels consisting of self-diagnosis, physician diagnosis, and medical compliance, Wegner (1987) describes the relevance of transactive memory in health behavior. Beginning with a patient’s self-diagnosis, Wegner argues that the assessment of symptoms and the decision to seek treatment is a social process where individuals consult family and friends (Wegner, 1987). An individual develops a hypothesis to describe their symptoms and considers the hypotheses of their friends and family who have varied experiences and knowledge (Wegner, 1987). In light of these interactions and knowledge exchanges, the individual makes the decision to seek care or not often with the consensus of the group.  In the case provider diagnosis, Wegner conceptualizes the physician-patient dialogue as a transactive memory process (1987). The physician is an expert on illness and the patient is the \n","185  expert in their symptoms (Wegner, 1987). Both the physician and patient are aware of their own expertise and the expertise of the other and operate jointly to engage in transactive information retrieval (Wegner, 1987). The patient’s hypothesis of their illness leads them to report symptoms most aligned with their anticipated diagnosis (Wegner, 1987). For example, if the patient believes they have appendicitis, they are likely to prioritize reporting abdominal pain and deprioritize reporting a stuffy nose. The patient is likely to disclose their hypothesized illness label to the provider (Wegner, 1987). The provider must then decide how much credence to afford this hypothesis (Wegner, 1987).  In the case of prescription and compliance of a physician’s recommendation (e.g., medication, diet), Wegner describes the provider initiating the prescription and the patient complying to the recommendation (1987). To prevent accidental or intentional noncompliance, Wegner recommends strengthening the transactive memory system surrounding the patient by integrating care partner (1987). Informing family and friends of the recommended regime can distribute the responsibility of remembering to take a medication, for example. Wegner indicates that informing care partners of the regime is simple but is often overlooked as patients’ memories are conceptualized as individual, independent systems and not a part of transactive memory systems.  In summary, transactive memory provides the infrastructure to understand how individuals “think” together and understand how disparate minds operate jointly to complete work. Unlike earlier group think or group mind models, transactive memory integrates the system of interconnection and interdependence that exist among individuals’ information communications, emphasizing the social organizational diversity.  \n","186  A1.3.3 Application of transactive memory to disposition decision-making  Transactive memory may be able to provide insight into whether and how ED physicians engage with others during the disposition decision-making process. Transactive memory provides the infrastructure for identifying the role that each individual serves in the network and could give insight into how interpersonal interactions occur. Transactive memory provides a lens into the information encoding, storage, and retrieval, but little insight into how a decision is made. Questions like “how is retrieved information used during decision-making?” and “how are differences of opinion reconciled?” remain. As such, transactive memory research is likely insufficient for capturing the entire disposition decision-making process but may be able to provide some insight into work system factors (e.g., person, tasks). Used in concert with a decision-making or work systems model, transactive memory research may be useful in understanding disposition decision-making.  A1.4 Shared Decision-Making A1.4.1 Definition and characteristics of shared decision-making  Proposed as alternative to more paternalistic models of patient care (i.e., the physician makes all of the decisions), shared decision-making (SDM) approaches have emerged in response to the shift toward patient-centered care practices (Frosch & Kaplan, 1999; Godolphin, 2009; Parsons, 2013). According to Charles and colleagues, on the continuum of medical decision-making, SDM falls between paternalistic decision-making (i.e., provider makes the choice) and informed decision-making (i.e., patient makes the choice) (Charles et al., 1999). Godolphin refers to SDM as “the practical reconciliation of respect of persons (autonomy) and the monopoly and power of physicians: the middle ground between ‘nanny-knows-best’ paternalism and rampant consumerism” (Godolphin, 2009, p. e. 186). \n","187  However, given the vast and sometimes disparate literature on SDM, there is no single or shared definition of SDM (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019; Makoul & Clayman, 2006; Moumjid et al., 2007). Albeit, many definitions contain similar concepts such as patient values/preferences, options, partnerships, etc. (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019; Makoul & Clayman, 2006). One of the most cited definitions of SDM comes from Charles and colleagues (Charles et al., 1997; Makoul & Clayman, 2006; Moumjid et al., 2007). They identified four characteristics that represent the minimum or necessary criteria to characterize an interaction as SDM: 1) involves at least two participants, the provider and patient, 2) both participants take steps to participate in the process of decision-making, 3) both participants share information with one another, and 4) a decision is made and both participants agree to the decision (Charles et al., 1997).  SDM is often associated with treatment decisions (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019). However, researchers have begun to explore its utility in other decision types, specifically where equipoise is common, and in a variety of clinical settings (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019; Kraus & Marco, 2016; Probst et al., 2017). Because SDM can be used to develop trust between a patient and a provider, it can be an especially powerful tool in the ED where most patients and providers do not have an established relationship yet decisions are cognitively intensive, are often time-sensitive, and require a high degree of communication (Hibbard et al., 1997; Kraus & Marco, 2016).   A1.4.2 Models of shared decision-making   Numerous theoretical and pragmatic or guideline-based models of SDM have emerged. However, many these SDM models contain similar features. As such, I will explore a few of the \n","188  most foundational and relevant models in detail and discuss overall trends that I have identified in the literature (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019).  A1.4.2.1 Towle and Godolphin (1999) – Informed shared decision-making Expanding upon the primarily conceptual notion of “informed patient choice”, Towle and Godolphin introduced the concept of informed shared decision-making (ISDM) (Towle & Godolphin, 1999). Previous work related to informed patient choice provided a solid conceptual foundation but offered minimal description of the interactive process that must occur for a decision to be made (Entwistle et al., 1998; Towle & Godolphin, 1999). Towle and Godolphin define ISDM as “decisions that are shared by doctor and patient and informed by best evidence, not only about risks and benefits but also patient specific characteristics and values. It occurs in partnership that rests on explicitly acknowledged rights and duties and an expectation of benefit to both” (Towle & Godolphin, 1999, p. 766).  Although similar to the definition of SDM provided in section 2.2.4.1, the definition of ISDM is more robust in terms of how decisions are made, with what information, and with what expected outcome. However, the use of SDM, ISDM, and informed decision-making as synonyms is controversial (Moumjid et al., 2007). That being said, it is important to note that Towle and Godolphin were publishing at the same time as Charles and colleagues, who have been credited with discretely defining many of these terms (Charles et al., 1997, 1999). Thus, the inconsistent use of terms in these earlier models could a relic of different research groups approaching the same problem from different backgrounds, with different ideas, at the same time.   Towle and Godolphin developed a set of eight competencies for providers and seven competencies for patients, which they define as “the knowledge, skills and abilities that represent \n","189  the instructional intents of a programme, stated as specific goals” (McAshan, 1979). These competencies were developed from a review of the literature and were validated through semis-structured interviews with family providers, patients, and patient educators (Towle & Godolphin, 1999). The eight competencies for providers include:  1. Develop a partnership with the patient 2. Establish or review the patient's preferences for information (such as amount or format) 3. Establish or review the patient's preferences for role in decision-making (such as risk taking and degree of involvement of self and others) and the existence and nature of any uncertainty about the course of action to take 4. Ascertain and respond to patient's ideas, concerns, and expectations (such as about disease management options) 5. Identify choices (including ideas and information that the patient may have) and evaluate the research evidence in relation to the individual patient 6. Present (or direct patient to) evidence, taking into account competencies 2 and 3, framing effects (how presentation of the information may influence decision-making), etc. Help patient to reflect on and assess the impact of alternative decisions with regard to his or her values and lifestyle 7. Make or negotiate a decision in partnership with the patient and resolve conflict 8. Agree an action plan and complete arrangements for follow up (Godolphin, 2009; Towle & Godolphin, 1999). The seven competencies for patients include:  1. Define (for oneself) the preferred doctor-patient relationship 2. Find a physician and establish, develop, and adapt a partnership \n","190  3. Articulate (for oneself) health problems, feelings, beliefs, and expectations in an objective and systematic manner 4. Communicate with the physician to understand and share relevant information (such as from competency 3) clearly and at the appropriate time in the medical interview 5. Access information 6. Evaluate information 7. Negotiate decisions, give feedback, resolve conflict, agree on an action plan (Towle & Godolphin, 1999).  In summary, Towle and Godolphin’s set of competencies for ISDM were developed out of a necessity to operationalize the patient-centered aspect of informed patient choice. The two sets of competencies are designed to function synergistically and provide a clear list of expectations for both patients and providers.  Expanding on this work, in 2000, Elwyn and colleagues conducted focus groups with general practitioners to assess existing protocols for patient involvement in decision-making, including Towle and Godolphin’s set of competencies and other works (Elwyn et al., 2000). Elwyn and colleagues developed a set of eight competencies that mirror and expand upon Towle and Godolphin’s work. The eight provider competencies are as follows:  1. Implicit or explicit involvement of patients in decision-making process  2. Explore ideas, fears, and expectations of the problem and possible treatments 3. Portrayal of equipoise and options 4. Identify preferred format and provide tailor-made information 5. Checking process: understanding of information and reactions (e.g., ideas, fears, and expectations of possible options) \n","191  6. Checking process: acceptance of process and decision-making role preference 7. Make, discuss, or defer decisions involving patients to the extent they desire to be involved 8. Arrange follow-up (Elwyn et al., 2000) The key differences between these two sets of eight provider competencies is that in Elwyn and colleagues’ set, the portrayal of alternatives occurs before determining whether the patient wants to be involved in the decision-making process while in Towel and Godolphin’s set the steps are reversed (Elwyn et al., 2000). Elwyn and colleagues’ (2000) note that this key difference is critical as, in some cases where the decision is difficult, the patient may withdraw from the decision-making process after alternatives are shared. Further, they note that the patient’s preferences will adapt based on the perceived skill of the provider, the patient’s own personality, and other sociodemographic variables (Elwyn et al., 2000).   A1.4.2.2 Charles and colleagues (1999) – Models of treatment decision-making  Charles and colleagues described and organized three categories of treatment decision-making: paternalistic, shared, and informed (Charles et al., 1999). Charles and colleagues situated these three categories of treatment decision-making along a continuum and described the following analytical stages for each: information exchange, deliberation, and decision on treatment to implement (Charles et al., 1999). For the purposes of the present analysis, I will focus on their description of SDM.  Information exchange relates to the type and amount of information shared between the patient and provider and the directionality of the information. For an exchange to qualify as SDM, according to Charles and colleagues’ definition (Charles et al., 1997), the provider should share information related to the decision including treatment alternatives, the advantages and \n","192  disadvantages of each alternative, and potential outcomes for each alternative (Charles et al., 1999). The patient must share information on any relevant issues such as values, preferences, life-style, etc. This bidirectional exchange of information ensures that the provider and patient explore alternatives in light of the patient’s situation and circumstances (Charles et al., 1999).  Deliberation relates to “the process of expressing and discussing treatment preferences” (Charles et al., 1999, p. 656). In SDM, deliberation occurs during the interaction between the patient and provider (Charles et al., 1999). Some argue that the exchange of information is sufficient (Charles et al., 1999). However, Charles and colleagues argue that the exchange of information provides the inputs for deliberation. For a successful deliberation, both the provider and the patient must believe that there are multiple alternatives (Charles et al., 1999). Usually, patients are required to choose between two sets of alternatives. The first set of alternatives features two different treatments (Charles et al., 1999). The second set of alternatives features a treatment and doing nothing (Charles et al., 1999). The interaction between the provider and the patient could be explicit or implicit. Further, the patient may choose to involve others in the deliberation process (e.g., care partner), which can make the interaction more complicated but may be necessary if the decision influences others (e.g., the patient making the decision to receive care at home) (Charles et al., 1999).  The decision to implement a treatment relates to choosing a treatment (Charles et al., 1999). Through deliberation, the patient and the provider have built consensus and are invested in the final decision (Charles et al., 1999). With a shared understanding, the patient and the provider decide what treatment to pursue (Charles et al., 1999).  In summary, this framework contextualizes SDM within other forms medical decision-making and outlines the analytical stages and minimum requirements at each stage for SDM to \n","193  occur. Although this model focuses specifically on treatment, it is possible to see how these concepts could be applied to other clinical decisions, like disposition decision-making. However, this model focuses specifically on the interaction and information exchange between the ED physician and the patient and does not consider other factors that may influence the decision.  A1.4.2.3 Whitney (2003) – Levels of certainty and importance   Whitney developed an empirical model rooted conceptually in the notion that patients relinquish decision-making control to providers when a problem has one correct solution but want to be involved when there are multiple options, and that two of the most important characteristics of medical decisions are effect on the patient and the degree to which those decisions have medical consensus (Braddock III et al., 1999; Deber & Baumann, 1992; Deber et al., 1996; Whitney, 2003). Whitney conceptualizes shared medical decisions as occurring between patients and providers in light of two characteristics: importance and certainty (Whitney, 2003).  Importance refers to the seriousness of a decision considering its potential effect on a patient’s health and well-being, and potential moral, financial, social, legal and aesthetic outcomes (Whitney, 2003). Importance is determined by medical facts and personal values (Whitney, 2003). The importance of a decision may differ for patients and providers (Whitney, 2003). Importance can be mapped on a continuous scale including the following levels of importance: major, important, routine, and minor (Whitney, 2003). When importance is major, Whitney argues that providers should educate their patients so as to help them understand information available and make a decision (Whitney, 2003).  Certainty refers to “the degree to which a decision-analytic approach using good-quality data would demonstrate that there is a single preferred intervention” (Whitney, 2003, p. 276). \n","194  Without evidence, certainty could be assessed using expert opinion. When two providers disagree about the course of action, the patient should be informed and offered another opinion (Whitney, 2003). Certainty can be mapped on a scale including high certainty, intermediate certainty, and low certainty (Whitney, 2003). When there is low certainty, the patient’s decision should be given priority (Whitney, 2003).  All medical decisions can be placed on a Cartesian plane, where the horizontal axis depicts certainty from low to high and the vertical axis depicts importance from low to high (Whitney, 2003). The placement of each decision on the plane will vary by patient and circumstance. The plane can be separated into four zones: patient priority, provider priority, potential conflict, and shared priority (Whitney, 2003). Patient priority encompasses decisions of high importance and low certainty (i.e., the upper left corner of the second quadrant) (Whitney, 2003). An example of this type of decision is choosing between a mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation for localized breast cancer (Whitney, 2003). Provider priority encompasses decisions of high certainty and low importance (i.e., the lower right corner of the fourth quadrant) (Whitney, 2003). An example of this type of decision would be a provider ordering a secondary X-ray to expose a fracture from another angle (Whitney, 2003). Potential conflict refers to decisions of major importance and high certainty (i.e., the upper right corner of the first quadrant) (Whitney, 2003). Because the decision is important, the patient should feel empowered to decide against the provider’s advice (Whitney, 2003). Likewise, because there is a high degree of certainty and likely only one medically sound option, the provider may strongly encourage the patient to act according to their recommendation (Whitney, 2003). Whitney notes that in these situations, the patient usually accepts the provider’s recommendation. However, one can envision circumstances where conflicts may arise. For \n","195  example, pregnant woman who is diagnosed with an aggressive cancer may be strongly recommended surgery and chemotherapy, which could terminate her pregnancy. The woman may decide to forego treatment in favor of completing her pregnancy (Whitney, 2003).  Shared priority encompasses decisions characterized by all other combinations of uncertainty and importance (Whitney, 2003). These decisions are negotiated between the provider and patient, and how the decision is made will depend the decision (Whitney, 2003). Some decisions will require an information-rich conversation (e.g., the decision to try to revascularize a leg verses amputate) while others will only require a concise conversation (e.g., running a blood panel) (Whitney, 2003).  In summary, this model provides a mechanism to assess the interaction between importance and uncertainty in a decision. The characterization of decisions across these two variables gives insight into whose perspective should primarily guide decision-making and how decisions should be made. In that regard, the model also suggests that there are some types of decisions that are not well-suited for SDM. Further, Whitney recognizes that patients and providers do not act independently. For example, patients may consider input from care partners and providers from colleagues. Further, “outside factors” may influence the decision (e.g., insurance policies). Whitney notes that “these influences do not lessen the validity of the preferences of the patient and the provider” (Whitney, 2003, p. 276). However, within the model, Whitney provides no mechanism to capture the existence or influence of these factors.  A1.4.2.4 Makoul and Clayman (2006) – An integrated model of shared decision-making   Through a comprehensive and critical search of the literature, Makoul and Clayman propose a model of SDM that is conceptually sound and useful in both research and clinical practice (Makoul & Clayman, 2006). The model delineates essential elements, ideal elements, \n","196  and general qualities of SDM. Essential elements are necessary for SDM to occur (e.g., define/explain problem, present options, patient values, preferences) (Makoul & Clayman, 2006). Ideal elements are not necessary but are likely to enhance the decision-making experience (e.g., unbiased information, definition of roles, mutual agreement) (Makoul & Clayman, 2006). General qualities refer to characteristics that broadly describe SDM (e.g., information exchange, involves 2+ people, partnership) (Makoul & Clayman, 2006). Makoul and Clayman note that discussion of essential or ideal elements can be initiated by either the provider or the patient, thereby not forcing the responsibility onto a single participant.   To compliment the list of essential elements, ideal elements, and general characteristics, Makoul and Clayman developed a scale that depicts that degree of sharing that occurs during the discussion of elements. The scale ranges from “doctor alone” to “patient alone”, with “shared equally” in the center. They note that whichever participant facilitates the discussion, “the degree of sharing increases as input from the other party increases” (Makoul & Clayman, 2006, p. 307). Based on the elements and the scale, Makoul and Clayman suggest that it is possible for SDM to occur if the provider assumes decision-making responsibility, provided the patient willingly relinquished the shared responsibility and that the essential elements are present.   In summary, Makoul and Clayman synthesized and reconciled a vast body of literature to develop a comprehensive, yet applicable definition of SDM. Although the elements of SDM may be difficult to identify in practice (e.g., what does true discussion of patient values look like?), the description of key elements and the delineation between elements that are essential and ideal is critical to understanding the range of SDM definitions and characteristics presented in the literature.  \n","197  A1.4.2.5 Elwyn and colleagues (2012) – A shared decision-making model (three-talk model) The model developed by Elwyn and colleagues in 2012 identifies three steps of SDM including: choice talk, option talk, and decision talk. Choice talk relates to the stage of ensuring that the patient knows that there are reasonable alternatives available (Elwyn et al., 2012). Option talk relates to sharing information about alternatives. Decision talk relates to supporting the work of assessing alternatives in light of preferences and determining which is best (Elwyn et al., 2012). Within each of these steps, the provider supports deliberation. Deliberation refers to assessing advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives, considering the implications of each alternative, and envisioning possible outcomes, both practical and emotional (Elwyn et al., 2012). Both option talk and decision talk can be bolstered by decision support interventions. Decision support interventions provide informational “inputs” to the SDM process. Over the course of SDM, a patient’s preferences will transform from initial to informed (Elwyn et al., 2012).  Thee three steps are presented linearly but may not occur exclusively in a linear pattern. Further, Elwyn and colleagues note that this model could be operationalized in a variety of ways. For example, choice talk could occur through an email, a letter, a phone call, or an in-person meeting if the decision type permits. For each step, Elwyn and colleagues provide a set of sub-steps that detail specific types of questions and topics of discussion that are necessary to complete each step.  In summary, this intentionally simplified model provides a summary of the key steps of SDM and can be easily adapted to fit the circumstance. This model builds upon previous work in that it integrates the ethical underpinnings of SDM and describes the steps and skills required to successfully engage in SDM. \n","198  However, this model has received criticism. Some found the terms uninterpretable (e.g., the distinction between choice talk and option talk is unclear) (Elwyn et al., 2017). Others noted the absence of a distinct mention of risk communication or goal setting, both of which are perceived to be critical aspects of SDM (van de Pol et al., 2016). Others felt like the model did not emphasize the exploration of patient preferences or context sufficiently (Elwyn et al., 2017). Still, others felt like the model did not capture the goal of SDM to promote a patient’s “autonomous capacity”, emphasize the emotional and relational aspects of care, or prioritize the patient’s need to be supported during decision-making (Elwyn et al., 2017).  In response to these critiques, Elwyn and colleagues revised the 2012 model. The revised model, named the three-talk model of SDM, reconfigures and renames many of the same features of the original model (Elwyn et al., 2017). Choice talk was renamed to team talk (Elwyn et al., 2017). The three stages of talk were transformed from a linear progression to a cyclical progression (Elwyn et al., 2017). The goal of the redesigned model was to serve as a visual guide for clinicians in their practice (Elwyn et al., 2017). Thus, this model is unlikely to be useful in comprehensively describe how the context within which disposition decision-making occurs.  A1.4.2.6 Probst and colleagues (2017) – A guiding framework for shared decision-making in the ED   Probst and colleagues provide a pragmatic framework that describes how to determine if SDM is appropriate and how to engage in an SDM conversation in the ED (Probst et al., 2017). To determine whether SDM is appropriate, Probst and colleagues identify three factors that a provider must consider. First, a decision must be associated with clinical uncertainty or equipoise (Probst et al., 2017). Clinical equipoise refers to a situation where one alternative is not obviously “better” than another and the provider has no preference to one option over another (Elwyn et al., 2000; Elwyn et al., 2009). For example, Probst and colleagues provide an example \n","199  of equipoise as it manifests in disposition decision-making for a patient with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with an unremarkable ED evaluation:  “Both disposition decisions [that is, admission or discharge] could be deemed medically reasonable, and yet could have vastly different repercussions for the patient. If the patient is admitted, they will incur costs and experience the inconvenience of hospitalization, the possibility of iatrogenic injury or false-positive findings. On the other hand, if the patient is discharged, s/he risks recurrence of pain and the low likelihood of a missed ACS. The patient may prefer to avoid the disruption associated with hospitalization and undergo provocative cardiac testing as an outpatient, even if this is associated with a small medical risk. Conversely, the patient may feel unsafe going home and prefer to expedite the evaluation by being admitted” (Probst et al., 2017, p. 3) Second, unlike other forms of decision-making where the locus of control resides with the provider, SDM can only function when both the provider and the patient are able to meaningfully contribute (Probst et al., 2017). This means that the patient must be willing and able to participate in decision-making. Specifically, the patient or a proxy must have the cognitive capacity, skills, and self-efficacy to make decisions related to their care (Probst et al., 2017). Third, SDM requires a dedicated segment of time (Probst et al., 2017). Thus, factors related to the patient’s acuity or the ED environment may prevent this from occurring. For example, if a patient’s acuity is too great, engaging in SDM may put the patient’s wellbeing at risk (Probst et al., 2017). Further, ED providers are often responsible for managing multiple patients at once and are required to be aware of the state of the ED overall (Probst et al., 2017). As such, an ED provider may not be able to engage in SDM if doing so would sacrifice the care and safety of other patients or disrupt the overall flow of the ED (Probst et al., 2017).    \n","200  Once it has been determined that SDM is appropriate, there are four steps that must occur to engage in SDM. First, the ED provider must make clear that a clinical decision must be made and that there are alternatives to select among (Probst et al., 2017). The ED provider should outline what they are going to discuss and the purpose of the discussion. Second, the ED provider should share information related to alternatives, the potential advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, and the potential outcomes for each alternative (Probst et al., 2017). Once alternatives have been presented, the conversation could be guided by the patient’s follow-up questions. Probst and colleagues urge providers to share this information in segments and use plain language so as not to overwhelm the patient. They further note that decision aids can be useful in communicating alternatives at this stage. Third, the ED provider should elicit and explore the patient’s values, preferences, and specific circumstances (Probst et al., 2017). Probst and colleagues suggest asking questions that lead to a conversation about the patient’s thoughts, priorities, and any social factors that may influence a patient’s preferences or ability to achieve favorable outcomes with an alternative (e.g., do you live alone?). Fourth, the ED provider and the patient should decide together on the best alternative given the patient’s values, preferences, and specific circumstances (Probst et al., 2017). The ultimate decision could be based on the ED provider’s suggestion, as many patients are inclined to trust providers’ knowledge and judgement but would ideally be based on the patient’s assessment. If a patient urges the provider to share their opinion (e.g., what would you do if you were in my situation?), providers should aim to offer suggestions in based on the extent to which the options align with the patient’s values (e.g., if you are nervous about going home because you live alone, it might make sense to stay at the hospital) (Probst et al., 2017).  \n","201  In summary, this framework provides a practical set of questions or factors to consider where determining whether and how to engage in disposition decision-making in the ED. This framework draws from and presents foundational patient-centered and ethical factors in a way that is logical and applicable to the ED. However, given that this model serves more as a framework for clinicians, it is unlikely to provide comprehensive insight into the context within which disposition decision-making occurs.  A1.4.3 Themes of shared decision-making  A1.4.3.1 Advantageous themes With respect to conceptual components of SDM, of the models presented here and others in the literature, the majority share the same two foundational principles:  1. Ensure that the patient understands the alternatives and the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives  2. Ensure that the patient’s goals and preferences guide decision-making (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019; Makoul & Clayman, 2006; Moumjid et al., 2007; Quality, 2020)  All of the models presented here and other in the literature note the necessity of the involvement of two or more individuals (Bomhof-Roordink et al., 2019). All of the models presented here, even those specific to the ED, depict SDM as a staged set of steps or processes that unfold overtime. The models presented here ranged in terms of how SDM should be initiated. Whether explicit or implicit, some of the models rely on the provider to assess the appropriateness of SDM and facilitate SDM, if appropriate (Probst et al., 2017; Whitney, 2003). Others are either ambiguous in terms of who should initiate or distribute that responsibility between the patient and the provider (Charles et al., 1999; Elwyn et al., 2017; Elwyn et al., 2000; Elwyn et al., 2012; Makoul & Clayman, 2006; Towle & Godolphin, 1999).  \n","202  A1.4.3.2 Disadvantageous themes and gaps Most research on SDM argues if the responsibility for SDM resides with the provider, more paternalistic tendencies will manifest in the provider-patient relationship (Towle & Godolphin, 1999). Yet, many SDM models are oriented toward provider-initiated discussions and tasks (Elwyn et al., 2000). Such approaches treat the patient more as an information source and a final check as opposed to a partner in decision-making (Charles et al., 1997; Emanuel & Emanuel, 1992). However, the collaboration that occurs in SDM is important as most patients do not have a sense of their preferences a priori and develop their preferences on an as-need basis as decision-making in healthcare situations unfold (Hibbard et al., 1997).   With respect to applicability, Wirtz and colleagues point out that clinical decision-making models, including SDM, have two key limitations (Wirtz et al., 2006). First, models fail to describe how providers and patients develop or discover the scope of alternatives. There are likely to be numerous factors that influence the set of options patients and providers consider (e.g., what is considered medically acceptable, payer, organizational constraints) (Whitney, 2003; Wirtz et al., 2006). Second, models fail to provide a description of how deliberation and joint decision-making should occur (Wirtz et al., 2006). Without a rich description of how this process occurs, deliberation and decision-making may be seen as a transactional or technical task as opposed to a complex and iterative process (Walker & Carayon, 2009).  A1.4.4 Application of shared decision-making to disposition decision-making   SDM models provide insight into the types of discussions that are needed to arrive at a clinical decision. As Probst and colleagues highlight in their example shown in section 2.2.4.2, SDM could be appropriate for disposition decision-making (Probst et al., 2017). Pragmatically, SDM is a concept that most providers and healthcare researchers understand or are at least aware \n","203  of. SDM is rooted in healthcare quality improvement and patient safety, and many would agree that SDM should be the “default” in most healthcare decisions (Godolphin, 2009; Probst et al., 2017; Weston, 2001). However, current SDM models offer limited insight into the cognitive decision-making process and capture only some of the context needed to fully understand how disposition decision-making occurs (Wirtz et al., 2006). This is critical as “the rapidly paced and often chaotic ED environment is a unique clinical setting that offers many contextual challenges [to SDM]” (Hess et al., 2015). Further, few physicians use SDM in practice and report numerous challenges to implementing SDM in the ED (Godolphin, 2009; Hess et al., 2015; Probst et al., 2015). Thus, SDM may be better suited for conceptualizing the future of disposition decision-making in the ED as opposed to capturing how disposition decision-making occurs at present.  A1.5 Heuristics  A1.5.1 Definition and conceptual underpinning of heuristics  Conceptualized as one of the three approaches (i.e., logic, statistics/probability, heuristics) the human mind uses to make decisions, the concept of heuristics emerged across a variety of fields including physics, biology, economics, computer science, psychology, and others throughout the 20th century (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). There are numerous definitions of a heuristic (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). A comprehensive definition that draws from others’ definitions of heuristics comes from Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier (2011): “a heuristic is a strategy that ignores part of the information, with the goal of making decisions more quickly, frugally, and/or accurately than more complex methods” (p. 454). More simply, heuristics are “simple decision algorithms that can work well in appropriate environments” (Todd & Gigerenzer, 2007) and are described as fast and frugal (Gigerenzer, 2008). Historically, heuristics have been associated with Systems 1 thinking, which is often considered to be error-\n","204  prone. However, Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier argue that such an association does not actually exist (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011).  Historically, the application of heuristics has been seen as an informal approach to decision-making. However, Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier argue that heuristics can and should be formalized through the definition of three “building blocks”:  1. Search rules specify in what direction the search extends in the search space  2. Stopped rules specify when the search is stopped 3. Decision rules specify how the final decision is reached (Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999 as cited in Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011) The “core capacities [of heuristics] include recognition memory, frequency monitoring, object tracking, and the ability to imitate” (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 456), which allow heuristics to be efficient (i.e., fast) and require little input (i.e., frugal). Just as an individual decides what statistical approach to use (e.g., regression vs. Bayesian statistics), individuals decide which heuristic to use. Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier (2011) identify four selection principles that describe how individuals decide which heuristic to use. First, heuristics and the associated core capacities are innate, to some extent, as a result of evolution (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Second, an individual’s education or learning influences their selection behavior (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Third, social processes serve as a means for individuals to select and learn heuristics (e.g., imitation, teaching) (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Fourth, the content and infrastructure of an individual’s memory influences which heuristics can be used (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). There are two primary explanations for why individuals use heuristics: the accuracy-effort tradeoff and the ecological rationality of heuristics (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). The \n","205  accuracy-effort tradeoff refers to the notion that to avoid effortful and time-consuming information searching and processing, humans rely on heuristics recognizing that there may be some loss in accuracy (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Further, there are two interpretations of tradeoffs: rational tradeoffs and cognitive limitations (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Rational tradeoffs refer to the notion that not all decisions are sufficiently important to require deep consideration and therefore individuals engage in fast and frugal cognition instead (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Thus, the time-saved out-weighs the potential of higher accuracy that could be gained with a more time-intensive cognitive process (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Cognitive limitations refer to the capacity limitations that hinder individuals from operating rationally and instead require them to rely on heuristics (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011).  Ecological rationality refers to extent to which heuristics that are well-suited for the structure of the environment (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). The exploration of ecological rationality answers the following two questions: “how does cognition exploit environmental structures, and how does it deal with error?” (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 457). To address the first question, it is important to first understand how “environmental structure” is defined. Environmental structure describes how well the decision processes align with the environments within which they occur (i.e., the mind-world interactions) (Todd & Gigerenzer, 2007; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2012).  Although there are numerous heuristics and numerous ways to categorize heuristics, Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier identify four categories of heuristics: recognition-based decision-making, one-reason decision-making, tradeoff heuristics, and social heuristics (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011).  \n","206  A1.5.2 Heuristic models  A1.5.2.1 Recognition-based decision-making   The concept of recognition-based decision-making draws from the recognition memory literature suggesting that the similarity or familiarity of information (i.e., recognition) is available sooner than relational information (i.e., recollection) during information processing (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011; Ratcliff & McKoon, 1989). In recognition-based decision-making, heuristics base “judgements on recognition information only” and disregard all other cues (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 460). Examples of heuristics that fall under this category of heuristic are the recognition heuristic and fluency heuristic.   Recognition heuristic: The purpose of the recognition heuristic is “make inferences about a criterion that is not directly accessible to the decision maker, based on recognition retrieved from memory” (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 460). When there are two alternatives for a given choice, the recognition heuristic states that “if one of two objects is recognized and the other is not, then infer that the recognized object has higher value with respect to the criterion” (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002, p.76). This heuristic suitable for “environments in which recognition is correlated with the criterion being predicted” (Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2002, p. 78).  The strength of the association between the criterion, the mediator (i.e., objects in the environment that reflect or serve as a surrogate for the criterion and are accessible), and recognition memory is determined by three factors: ecological correlation, surrogate correlation, and recognition validity (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). Ecological correlation refers to the correlation between the criterion and the mediator (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). Surrogate correlation refers to the correlation between the mediator and recognition memory (Goldstein & \n","207  Gigerenzer, 2002). Recognition validity refers to the “proportion of times a recognized object has a higher criterion value than an unrecognized object in a reference class” (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002, p. 78). Through the realization of the recognition heuristic, it is possible to observe the less-is-more-effect where “those who know more exhibit lower inferential accuracy than those who know less” (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002, p. 79).  Fluency heuristic: The fluency heuristic states that “if both alternatives are recognized but one is recognized faster, then infer that this alternative has the higher value with respect to the criterion” (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 462). This heuristic applies when alternatives are given (e.g., a two-alternative choice) and when alternatives are not given (e.g., when a decision-making must make provide a choice from their memory) (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). The latter refers to a variable of the fluency heuristic called the “take-the-first” heuristic. Specifically, the take-the-first heuristic states that “in familiar yet ill-defined tasks, choose one of the initial options generated once a goal (and a strategy) has been defined, rather than exhaustively generating all possible options and subsequently processing them deliberatively” (Johnson & Raab, 2003, p. 218). Johnson and Raab argue that the options generated by an individual are informed by simple strategies and the environment triggers an associative memory network, thus yielding viable options (Johnson & Raab, 2003). Klein’s recognition-primed decision-making model, described in section 2.2.2.1, is conceptually similar to the take-the-first heuristic (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011).  A1.5.2.2 One-reason decision-making  Unlike recognition-based heuristics, this category of heuristics relies on recall. In one-reason decision-making, as the name suggests, heuristics base “judgements on one good reason only” and disregard all other cues (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 463). This category of \n","208  heuristics was initially developed to capture preferences but has been expanded to capture decisions (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). This category of model, sometimes referred to as models of bounded rationality, originate from Simon’s work on bounded rationality, most famously, the concept of satisficing (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996). Bounded rationality suggests that humans are unable to “feasibly consider…perfect[ly] rational decisions in practice [due] to the finite computational resources available for making them” (Albar & Jetter, 2009, p. 581). Examples of heuristics that fall under this category of heuristic are one-clever-cue heuristic and take-the-best.  One-clever-cue: This heuristic refers to a decision that is made based on a single, but influential cue (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). For example, in nature, when selecting a mate, peahens assess a few potential peacocks who are displaying their feathers and select the peacock with the most colorful feathers (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011; Petrie & Halliday, 1994).  Take-the-best: This heuristic can be summarized as “take the best, ignore the rest” (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996, p. 653) and describes how individuals determine which alternative has a larger value on a criterion (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). This value assessment is based on a binary cue value retrieved from an individual’s memory (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). This heuristic can be applied using fast-and-frugal trees, which are simple decision aids that allow decision-makers to quickly make decisions based on a set of pre-determined, sequential criteria (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011).  A1.5.2.3 Tradeoff heuristics  Unlike recognition and one-reason decision-making where non-dominant cues are disregarded (i.e., some cues are inherently weighted), tradeoff heuristics consider all cues as equally dominant (i.e., weighing all cues equally) (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Tradeoffs \n","209  refer to “a class of heuristics that weights all cues or alternatives equally and thus makes tradeoffs” (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 469). Examples of heuristics that fall under this category of heuristic are tallying and 1/N rule. Tallying involves summing the number of cues in favor of one alternative versus another. This heuristic can be applied using mapping models. Also known as the equality heuristic (Messick, 1993), the 1/N rule “allocates resources [(i.e., time, finances)] equally to each N alternative” (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 470).  A1.5.2.4 Social heuristics   Social heuristics refer to heuristics that draw from social information (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). Examples of heuristics that fall under this category include imitation heuristics (e.g., imitate the majority, imitate the successful), tit-for-tat, and the default heuristic (Gigerenzer, 2008). The imitate the majority heuristic refers to mimicking the actions of the majority of one’s peer group (Boyd & Richerson, 2005; Gigerenzer, 2008). The imitate the successful heuristic refers to mimicking the behavior of the most successful individual (Boyd & Richerson, 2005; Gigerenzer, 2008). The tit-for-tat heuristic refers to initial cooperation followed by mimicking one’s partner’s last action (Axelrod, 2012; Gigerenzer, 2008). The default heuristic refers to accepting the provided option (Johnson & Goldstein, 2003).  A1.5.3 Implications of heuristics for disposition decision-making  In summary, heuristics represent a deviation from the traditional prioritization of “optimal” decisions in favor of reflecting the reality of timely and satisfactory decision-making (Albar & Jetter, 2009; Simon, 1956). Although the practice of satisficing may reflect how some clinical decisions are made, it is important to consider that, in the case of disposition decision-making, physicians and patients are likely seeking the optimal choice as opposed to an alternative that could work. As described earlier, dispositioning patients to the location that best \n","210  supports their needs is critical to maintaining high quality care and promoting patient safety (Calder et al., 2010; Calder et al., 2012; Chamberlain & Pollack, 1998). At the same time, the ED represents a face-paced and often information-scare environment, which could make heuristics an appropriate fit as they are less time-consuming, require less informational input, and generally perform just as well or better than statistical or logical models (Gigerenzer, 2008; Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011; Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996).  Furthermore, because heuristics require few informational inputs and are mechanistic in how they produce decisions, they are transparent and easy to assess (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002), which could be useful in tracing a provider’s decision-making process. However, heuristics range in accuracy depending on their ecological rationality (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011), which could be problematic for decisions that occur in dynamic environments, like the ED, with decisions that have critical implications for patient survival and health, like disposition decisions (Davis & Jacques, 2008).  In practice, a relatively small portion of studies related to the use of heuristics in medical decision-making focus on provider or patient-and-provider decision-making, with most focusing on patient decision-making (Blumenthal-Barby & Krieger, 2015). In addition, most studies have used hypothetical examples or vignettes. A such, there is limited research exploring whether and how heuristics are used in clinical practice (Blumenthal-Barby & Krieger, 2015).  A1.6 Decision-making model summary  Overall, no single model provides sufficient detail nor mechanistic functionality to capture how the disposition decision-making process unfolds over time interacting with and occurring within a macro context and oriented toward specific outcomes.
